Executive Summary
Engagement Overview
Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the mint/burn feature and the
ERC20MigrationOutbox component. The new mint/burn feature of Nitro allows chain owners to mint and burn the network’s native token, enabling them to avoid locking up a significant amount of liquidity in a contract on the child chain for transferring the chain’s custom gas token between the parent and child chains. The ERC20MigrationOutbox component is designed to facilitate the migration of native tokens from the native Arbitrum bridge to an external bridge on orbit chains.
A team of three consultants conducted the review from May 14 to May 16, 2025, for a total of nine engineer-days of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the target, using automated and manual processes.
Observations and Impact
The security assessment focused on ensuring that the new mint/burn and
ERC20MigrationOutbox features are implemented securely and function as intended.
Our team conducted a comprehensive review of the Solidity contracts and Go implementation that enable authorized entities to mint and burn native gas tokens on
Arbitrum chains and to migrate native tokens from the native bridge into a custom bridge implementation.
Our review identified three issues: one low-severity finding related to improper timestamp validation in SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom that could unintentionally disable the native token management features (TOB-MINTBURN-1), and two informational-severity findings concerning retroactive timestamp modifications (TOB-MINTBURN-2) and undefined behavior in the usage of the mint/burn feature (TOB-MINTBURN-3). We also provide several code quality recommendations that, while not related to security vulnerabilities, would improve maintainability and user experience (appendix B).
Recommendations
We recommend addressing the three issues disclosed in this report and implementing the recommendations provided in the Code Quality Recommendations appendix.

Detailed Findings 1. Native token feature disabled if SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom’s timestamp is set to 0 or a future time
Severity: Low
Difficulty: High
Type: Data Validation
Finding ID: TOB-MINTBURN-1
Target: precompiles/ArbOwner.go

Description
The SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom function allows callers to set a timestamp to enable the native token management functionalities. The feature can be explicitly disabled by setting timestamp to 0. Alternatively, if the feature is currently active (meaning its stored enablement time is less than or equal to the current timestamp), setting timestamp to a future value will also make the feature inactive until that future timestamp is reached. This creates an unintended mechanism to disable the native token functionality.
if (stored == 0 && timestamp < now+NativeTokenEnableDelay) ||
​
(stored > now+NativeTokenEnableDelay && timestamp < now+NativeTokenEnableDelay) {
​ return ErrNativeTokenDelay
}
// If the feature is scheduled to be enabled earlier than the minumum delay,
// then the new time to enable it must be only further in the future.
if stored > now && stored <= now+NativeTokenEnableDelay && timestamp < stored {
​ return ErrNativeTokenBackward
} return c.State.SetNativeTokenEnabledFromTime(timestamp)
Figure 1.1: Snippet of the SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom function
(precompiles/ArbOwner.go#L81–L90)
Exploit Scenario
The stored timestamp is 100 and the current block time (now) is 120, so the feature is active. The chain owner calls SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom with timestamp set to 130 and makes the feature inactive until block time 130 is reached.
Recommendations
Short term, add validation to prevent callers of SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom from setting the feature’s enablement timestamp to a future value. Additionally, consider implementing a separate, explicit function for disabling the native token functionality.

Long term, enhance the test suite for setter functions to ensure that corner cases are covered for all possible input values.

2. SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom can be set to a past timestamp
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: High
Type: Data Validation
Finding ID: TOB-MINTBURN-2
Target: precompiles/ArbOwner.go

Description
The SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom function lacks validation for backward timestamp settings. This allows for the arbitrary change of the activation timestamp, nativeTokenEnabledTime, to any point in the past.
func (con ArbOwner) SetNativeTokenEnabledFrom(c ctx, evm mech, timestamp uint64)
error {
​ if timestamp == 0 {
​
​ return c.State.SetNativeTokenEnabledFromTime(0)
​
}
​ stored, err := c.State.NativeTokenEnabledFromTime()
​ if err != nil {
​
​ return err
​
}
​ now := evm.Context.Time
​
// If the feature is disabled, then the time must be at least 7 days in the
​
// future.
​
// If the feature is scheduled to be enabled more than 7 days in the future,
​
// and the new time is also in the future, then it must be at least 7 days
​
// in the future.
​ if (stored == 0 && timestamp < now+NativeTokenEnableDelay) ||
​
​
(stored > now+NativeTokenEnableDelay && timestamp < now+NativeTokenEnableDelay) {
​
​ return ErrNativeTokenDelay
​
}
​
// If the feature is scheduled to be enabled earlier than the minumum delay,
​
// then the new time to enable it must be only further in the future.
​ if stored > now && stored <= now+NativeTokenEnableDelay && timestamp < stored
{
​
​ return ErrNativeTokenBackward
​
}
​ return c.State.SetNativeTokenEnabledFromTime(timestamp)
}

​

For example, if the current time is 100 and the stored activation timestamp is 90, the chain owner could reset the activation timestamp all the way back to 1. This would allow the owner to retroactively modify when the native token functionality was activated.
Recommendations
Short term, add input validation to prevent backward timestamp adjustments.
Long term, enhance the test suite for setter functions to ensure that corner cases are covered for all possible input values.

3. Native token owners can still use the mint/burn feature even if it is disabled
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: High
Type: Undefined Behavior
Finding ID: TOB-MINTBURN-3
Target: precompiles/ArbNativeTokenManager.go

Description
Native token owners can use the mint/burn feature regardless of whether it is currently enabled.
// Mints some amount of the native gas token for this chain to the given address func (con ArbNativeTokenManager) MintNativeToken(c ctx, evm mech, amount huge) error
{
​ if !con.hasAccess(c) {
​
​ return c.BurnOut()
​
}
​ if err := c.Burn(mintBurnGasCost); err != nil {
​
​ return err
​
}

​ evm.StateDB.ExpectBalanceMint(amount)
​ evm.StateDB.AddBalance(c.caller, uint256.MustFromBig(amount), tracing.BalanceIncreaseMintNativeToken)
​ return nil
}

Figure 3.1: The MintNativeToken function in
(precompiles/ArbNativeTokenManager.go#24–L35)
As shown in figure 3.1, the only check performed during minting is whether the caller has access (i.e., whether they are a native token owner); there is no check for whether the feature is currently enabled. It is important to note that a native token owner can be added only by the chain owner and only under the condition that the feature is enabled at the time they are added.
According to the client, the process for disabling the feature involves removing the
NativeTokenManagement owners and deactivating the feature. It remains active until both steps have been completed. However, there is no documentation currently available for this behavior, so we recommend creating documentation for it.

Recommendations
Short term, consider including additional checks in the ArbNativeTokenManager precompiled contract to ensure the feature can be used only when it is enabled.
Long term, thoroughly document the intended behavior of the feature and the flow for enabling and disabling it.

B. Code Quality Recommendations
The following recommendations are not associated with any specific vulnerabilities.
However, addressing them will enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the future.
●​ Correct the three typos in these comments:
○​ arbos/arbosState/arbosstate.go#L216
○​ precompiles/ArbOwner.go#L85
●​ Add a specific migration event to the migrate function:
○​ src/bridge/extra/ERC20MigrationOutbox.sol#L30–L39
●​ Add a public-facing view function for users to know whether the native token functionality is active. There is no easy way for users to find this information in the current implementation.
●​ Move the IsNativeTokenOwner and GetAllNativeTokenOwners functions to the
ArbOwnerPublic contract. They are currently in ArbOwner, linked below:
○​ precompiles/ArbOwner.go#L114–L122
●​ Add zero-address checks in the ERC20MigrationOutbox contract’s constructor function:
○​ src/bridge/extra/ERC20MigrationOutbox.sol#L23–L27
●​ Add NativeTokenMinted and NativeTokenBurned events in the
ArbNativeTokenManager contract:
○​ src/precompiles/ArbNativeTokenManager.sol#L13–L29
●​ Add NatSpec comments to the IERC20MigrationOutbox interface functions and errors:
○​ src/bridge/extra/IERC20MigrationOutbox.sol#L10–L15
●​ Add a test case for the executeCall branch of the migrate function, which is not currently tested in ERC20MigrationOutbox.t.sol:
○​ src/bridge/extra/ERC20MigrationOutbox.sol#L35–L37

C. Fix Review Results
When undertaking a fix review, Trail of Bits reviews the fixes implemented for issues identified in the original report. This work involves reviewing specific areas of the source code and system configuration, not a comprehensive analysis of the system.
The Offchain Labs team has stated that the three issues disclosed in this report describe intended system behavior and, therefore, has not implemented fixes for these issues. The team did submit PR #3255, PR #3264, and PR #3260, which we reviewed from May 28 to
May 30, 2025. The first pull request introduces a restriction for L2-to-L1 messages that prevents withdrawals when the mint/burn feature is enabled. This adds an additional layer of security to prevent situations in which the native bridge becomes undercollateralized.
The two other pull requests implement UX improvements recommended in the Code
Quality Recommendations appendix.

Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or defects in the target system or codebase.
Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.
