Executive Summary
Engagement Overview
Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of changes related to the Euclid Upgrade.
These changes include OpenVM guest programs for the chunk, batch, and bundle verification circuits, changes to the Scroll smart contracts related to supporting a special state transition due to the change in the computation of the state root, and a Go command-line tool to validate states during the Euclid transition.
A team of two consultants conducted the review from February 24 to March 5, 2025, for a total of three engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on assessing the soundness and correctness of the zero-knowledge circuits, whether the Euclid finalization function works as specified, and whether the Go command-line tool can validate that the state of two nodes is identical at a certain block height. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the codebase, using automated and manual processes.
Observations and Impact
We identified two high-severity soundness issues (TOB-SCREUC-1 and TOB-SCREUC-2)
affecting the batch and bundle circuits that would allow obtaining a bundle proof for which a malicious prover could bypass the verification of the inner proofs for the chunk and batch circuits.
We identified two impactful but difficult-to-exploit issues (TOB-SCREUC-6 and
TOB-SCREUC-7) related to the GitHub actions used in the codebases that could undermine the security of the released images to DockerHub. Note that GitHub actions security was not in the audit’s scope; we identified these issues using a static analysis tool for GitHub actions.
We did not identify security issues in the smart contract related to the one-off Euclid finalization functionality or in the Go command-line utility. However, we found that the migration checker was tested only with test data and does not have associated unit tests for its subfunctions (see TOB-SCREUC-3).
Recommendations
Based on the findings identified during the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that
Scroll take the following steps:
●​ Remediate the findings disclosed in this report. These findings should be addressed as part of a direct remediation or any refactor that may occur when addressing other recommendations.
​
        Trail of Bits​ 3​

        PUBLIC​
​

●​ Add tests for the migration checker. The migration checker consists of several functions, each performing a specific verification test. These components are relatively self-contained and, therefore, can be tested against correct and incorrect inputs. Sufficient testing of the migration checker will help increase confidence in its correctness.

Project Goals
The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Scroll Euclid phase 1 code changes. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:
●​ Are there any soundness or correctness issues in the chunk, batch, and bundle verification circuits?
●​ Is the integration with the OpenVM verifier correctly implemented on the smart contract?
●​ Does the Go command-line tool correctly validate whether a given MPT and a ZKTrie correspond to the same inherent state?
●​ Can the Security Council correctly finalize the Euclid transition batch?
●​ Can the Euclid finalize function be maliciously used to finalize batches other than the transition batch?
●​ Does batch reverting correctly reset the Euclid batch index?
●​ Does the finalizeBundleWithProof function correctly prevent v4, v5, and v6 batches in the same bundle?

Project Coverage
This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:
●​ Zkvm-prover. We manually reviewed the chunk, batch, and bundle circuits, focusing on identifying potential soundness and correctness issues.
●​ Smart contracts. We manually reviewed the smart contracts, focusing on determining if the OpenVM verifier is correctly integrated to verify the zero-knowledge proof; if the Security Council can perform the Euclid state transition using the implemented functionality; if this functionality can be maliciously used after the Euclid transition occurs; and if batch reversion correctly updates the initialEuclidBatchIndex state variable. We additionally assessed whether the bundle proof and public input are stored in memory according to the memory layout in the documentation.
●​ Migration checker. We manually reviewed the migration checker tool, focusing on assessing whether the code faithfully checks that a zkTrie and a Merkle Patricia Trie both encode the same chain state.

Test Results
The results of this focused testing are detailed below.
Clippy
Clippy reports warnings for three idiomatic and performance rules: manual assert,
or_fun_call and explicit_iter_loop which we detailed in the Code Quality appendix. We recommend adding these rules to your regular Clippy runs.
zizmor
Running zizmor on the codebase identified findings TOB-SCREUC-6, TOB-SCREUC-7, and
TOB-SCREUC-8. We recommend adding zizmor to your CI/CD pipeline across the organization’s repositories.
cargo-edit
Cargo-edit identified several outdated dependencies, including some that are, in a semantic versioning sense, compatible with the version currently in use, and others that are not.
Consider integrating Dependabot to automatically update dependencies as soon as these are available.

Detailed Findings

1. The aggregation circuit does not validate the size of inner proofs
Severity: High
Difficulty: Low
Type: Cryptography
Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC-1
Target: circuits/types/src/lib.rs, circuits/batch-circuit/src/main.rs, circuits/bundle-circuit/src/main.rs

Description
The batch and bundle circuits are aggregation circuits. They aggregate proofs generated by inner circuits. They validate the aggregated public inputs and verify the proofs embedded in the witness. However, due to missing enforcement of the lengths of aggregated proofs, an aggregation circuit would verify an aggregated public input without the associated inner proof.
Figure 1.1 shows the main function of the batch circuit. The function calls
C::verify_proofs(witness), which verifies the inner proof embedded in the witness.
Subsequently, the aggregated public inputs are validated against the aggregated public input hashes.
fn main() {
    // Setup openvm extensions for the circuit.
    C::setup();
[...]
    // Verify the root proofs being aggregated in the circuit.
    let agg_proofs = C::verify_proofs(witness);

    // Get the public-input values of the proofs being aggregated from witness.
    let agg_pis = C::aggregated_public_inputs(witness);

    // Derive the digests of the public-input values of proofs being aggregated.
    let agg_pi_hashes = C::aggregated_pi_hashes(&agg_proofs);

    // Validate that the pi hashes derived from the root proofs are in fact the digests of the
    // public-input values of the previous circuit layer.
    C::validate_aggregated_pi(&agg_pis, &agg_pi_hashes);

[...]
    // Reveal the public-input values of the current circuit layer.
    C::reveal_pi(&public_inputs);

}
Figure 1.1: The main process of the batch circuit
(circuits/batch-circuit/src/main.rs#L18-L47)
Figure 1.2 shows that the proof verification function does not check the length of the received vector of proofs and can accept an empty vector. Therefore, the returned aggregated proofs, agg_proofs, are also empty.
/// Verify the proofs being aggregated.
///
/// Also returns the root proofs being aggregated.
fn verify_proofs(witness: &Self::Witness) -> Vec<proof::AggregationInput> { let proofs = witness.get_proofs();

    for proof in proofs.iter() {
        Self::verify_commitments(&proof.commitment); proof::verify_proof(&proof.commitment, proof.public_values.as_slice());
    }

    proofs
}
Figure 1.2: Verification of aggregated proofs (circuits/types/src/lib.rs#L69-L81)
As a consequence, the validation of the aggregated public inputs against the public input hashes—the call to  C::validate_aggregated_pi(&agg_pis, &agg_pi_hashes)
shown in figure 1.1—effectively verifies the aggregated public input against an empty list of hashes. Due to the use of zip, the lengths are checked for equality. With an empty vector of hash values, an assertion error would occur, and the circuit would terminate successfully.
/// Validate that the public-input values of the aggregated proofs are well-formed.
///
/// - That the public-inputs of contiguous chunks/batches are valid
/// - That the public-input values in fact hash to the pi_hash values from the root proofs.
fn validate_aggregated_pi(agg_pis: &[Self::AggregatedPublicInputs], agg_pi_hashes:
&[B256]) {
    // Validation for the contiguous public-input values.
    for w in agg_pis.windows(2) { w[1].validate(&w[0]);
    }

    // Validation for public-input values hash being the pi_hash from root proof.
    for (agg_pi, &agg_pi_hash) in agg_pis.iter().zip(agg_pi_hashes.iter()) { assert_eq!( agg_pi.pi_hash(), agg_pi_hash,
            "pi hash mismatch between proofs and witness computed"

        );
    }
}
Figure 1.3: Validation of aggregated public input against expected public input hashes
(circuits/types/src/lib.rs#L89-L107)
Exploit Scenario
An attacker wishes to produce a wrong aggregated proof for the bundle input. They generate an empty witness and fabricate aggregated inputs, which the circuit verifies.
Recommendations
Short term, ensure that the aggregated proofs are not empty. Use zip_eq when comparing elements expected to have the same size.
Long term, document invariants and assumptions that must hold in every part of the codebase.

2. Insufficient validation of chunk information and blob bytes in the batch circuit
Severity: High
Difficulty: Medium
Type: Cryptography
Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC-2
Target: crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/builder/v3.rs

Description
The witness validation in the batch circuit does not properly validate that the chunk information matches the provided blob bytes. This leads to the circuit returning a batch header hash that uses blob data proof inconsistent with the chunks in the batch.
Specifically, the batch circuit does not sufficiently validate that the chunk information transaction data digest matches the chunk data digest present in the EIP-4844 blob bytes, as it does not compare the length of the chunks_info slice with the length of the payload.chunk_data_digests slice.
// Validate the tx data is match with fields in chunk info for (chunk_info, &tx_data_digest) in chunks_info.iter().zip(payload.chunk_data_digests.iter())
{ assert_eq!(chunk_info.tx_data_digest, tx_data_digest);
}
Figure 2.1: crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/builder/v3.rs#L32-L37
For example, if chunks_info contains information about two chunks but the blob_bytes has encoded only the first chunk, the zip iteration will validate only the first chunk data digest, and the blob consistency check will generate a blob data proof that concerns only the first chunk.
Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover provides a witness value with a different number of chunks for the chunk_info and the blob_bytes, resulting in a batch information PI that is inconsistent:
it contains a batch hash with the only the chunks in blob_bytes, but its state root and withdraw root concern the last chunk in chunk_info.
Recommendations
Short term, ensure that the lengths of chunks_info and payload.chunk_data_digests match, either with a separate assertion or by using zip_eq.

3. MPT migration code lacks unit tests
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: High
Type: Testing
Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC-3
Target: go-ethereum/cmd/migration-checker/main.go

Description
As part of the Euclid upgrade, the Scroll team will migrate the chain state from the current zktrie to a Merkle Patricia Tree (MPT). The team has developed a tool in Go that allows the security council to check for a faithful migration of the chain’s state. However, there are no unit tests to ensure that the migration checker is implemented correctly.
The migration checker code contains several subfunctions that perform specific verification tasks. Figure 3.1 shows a function used to check that storage nodes are equal across the zktrie and MPT data structures. The function scope is small enough and self-contained to enable unit tests exercising its behavior in both expected and adversarial scenarios.
func checkStorageEquality(label string, _ *dbs, zkStorageBytes, mptStorageBytes
[]byte, _ bool) {
​ zkValue := common.BytesToHash(zkStorageBytes)
​
_, content, _, err := rlp.Split(mptStorageBytes)
​ panicOnError(err, label, "failed to decode mpt storage")
​ mptValue := common.BytesToHash(content)
​ if !bytes.Equal(zkValue[:], mptValue[:]) {
​
​ panic(fmt.Sprintf("%s storage mismatch: zk: %s, mpt: %s", label, zkValue.Hex(), mptValue.Hex()))
​
}
}
Figure 3.1: (go-ethereum/cmd/migration-checker/main.go#158–166)
However, the Scroll team has tested the migration checker on some of its test nodes.
Though this test was successful, it may not necessarily guarantee the robustness of the code against incorrect inputs.
Recommendations
Short term, write unit tests for the migration checker before deployment. Ensure that both correctness and robustness are tested appropriately.
Long term, ensure all critical software used for irreversible tasks is appropriately tested.

4. Incorrect data present on BundleInfo
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: N/A
Type: Data Validation
Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC-4
Target: crates/circuits/bundle-circuit/src/circuit.rs

Description
The BundleCircuit::validate function returns an incorrect prev_state_root value in the BundleInfo data. Instead of first_batch.parent_batch_hash, the correct value is first_batch.parent_state_root.
let prev_state_root = first_batch.parent_batch_hash.into(); let prev_batch_hash = first_batch.parent_batch_hash.into();
Figure 4.1: crates/circuits/bundle-circuit/src/circuit.rs#L57-L58
Given that the smart contract rederives the public inputs from independent data, incorrectly setting this value causes a correctness issue when verifying the proof on the smart contract side. The Scroll team has also independently identified this issue.
Recommendations
Short term, modify the code to use the correct field for prev_state_root.
Long term, document how each layer’s public inputs are used. Add tests verifying the correctness of the returned public inputs. Enforce end-to-end testing from proving to smart contract verification to ensure end-to-end correctness.

5. Lax parsing of chunk data payload
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: N/A
Type: Data Validation
Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC-5
Target: crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/payload.rs

Description
The Payload::from_payload function does not fully validate the metadata chunk sizes when less than N_MAX_CHUNKS are present.
The function parses the payload by 1) obtaining the number of chunks present valid_chunks, 2) obtaining the chunk size of each chunk up to N_MAX_CHUNKS and considering only the first valid_chunks lengths, and finally, obtaining the chunk bytes based on the metadata lengths while validating that no extra bytes remain at the end of the payload.
However, this procedure does not validate that if, for example, only two chunks are present, all the remaining N_MAX_CHUNKS-2 chunk lengths equal zero. This means that different metadata bytes can lead to the same chunk data digests, as the payload provider could state that the chunk lengths after chunk number two are arbitrary values, not changing the behavior of the rest of the parsing.
// Decoded batch bytes require segmentation based on chunk length let valid_chunks = metadata_bytes[..N_BYTES_NUM_CHUNKS]
    .iter()
    .fold(0usize, |acc, &d| acc * 256usize + d as usize);

let chunk_size_bytes = metadata_bytes[N_BYTES_NUM_CHUNKS..]
    .iter()
    .chunks(N_BYTES_CHUNK_SIZE); let chunk_lens = chunk_size_bytes
    .into_iter()
    .map(|chunk_bytes| chunk_bytes.fold(0usize, |acc, &d| acc * 256usize + d as usize))
    .take(valid_chunks);

// reconstruct segments let (segmented_batch_data, final_bytes) = chunk_lens.fold(
    (Vec::new(), batch_bytes),
    |(mut datas, rest_bytes), size| { datas.push(Vec::from(&rest_bytes[..size]));
        (datas, &rest_bytes[size..])
    },

);

assert!( final_bytes.is_empty(),
    "chunk segmentation len must add up to the correct value"
);
Figure 5.1: crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/payload.rs#L37-L62
Given that both the metadata digest and chunk digests are used in the computation of the challenge digest, we could not identify a way of further exploiting this issue.
Recommendations
Short term, validate that the size of the chunks past the number specified in valid_chunks equals zero, ensuring that each unique payload corresponds to a unique pair of metadata digests and batch data digests.

6. Docker release action is vulnerable to cache poisoning
Severity: Low
Difficulty: High
Type: Configuration
Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC-6
Target: go-ethereum/.github/workflows/{docker-arm64.yaml, docker.yaml}, scroll-contracts/.github/workflows/docker-release.yml

Description
The Docker release GitHub workflows use caching to store the buildx binary. An attacker who gains write access to the GitHub actions cache (e.g., through a valid GitHub token) can poison the cache and compromise the build process to maliciously alter build artifacts.

Figure 6.3: .github/workflows/docker-release.yml#31–39
Exploit Scenario
An attacker gains unauthorized access to a GitHub token with write permissions to the
GitHub actions cache. She uses this to poison the cache to inject a malicious buildx binary. When the Docker container is built, the final image is modified to download and run attacker-controlled software. Since the codebase is not tampered with directly, the attack goes unnoticed by the Scroll team.
Recommendations
Short term, in general, avoid using previously cached CI state within workflows intended to publish build artifacts such as Docker containers. Caching can be disabled by setting the cache-binary option to false.
Long term, add zizmor to the CI/CD pipeline to detect GitHub action–related issues.

Description
Several GitHub actions workflows in the go-ethereum and scroll-contracts
repositories use third-party actions pinned to a tag or branch name instead of a full commit
SHA as recommended by GitHub. This configuration enables repository owners to silently modify the actions. A malicious actor could use this ability to tamper with an application release or leak secrets.
The following actions are owned by GitHub organizations or individuals that are not affiliated directly with Scroll:
●​ foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
●​ hrishikesh-kadam/setup-lcov@v1
●​ codecov/codecov-action@v3
●​ docker/setup-qemu-action@v2

Exploit Scenario
An attacker gains unauthorized access to the account of a GitHub action owner. The attacker manipulates the action’s code to steal GitHub credentials and compromise the repository.
Recommendations
Short term, pin each third-party action to a specific full-length commit SHA, as recommended by GitHub. Additionally, configure Dependabot to update the actions’ commit SHAs after reviewing their available updates.
Long term, add zizmor to the CI/CD pipeline.

8. Potential credential persistence in artifacts and stale GitHub action
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: N/A
Type: Configuration
Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC-8
Target: scroll-contracts/.github/workflows/{contracts.yml, docker-release.yml}, go-ethereum/.github/workflows/*

Description
The default behavior of the actions/checkout GitHub action is to persist credentials, which means that the GitHub token is written to the local repository directory. This allows the action to execute Git commands that require authentication. The credentials are stored in .git/config files in the local repository directory, where they could be inadvertently included in workflow artifacts or accessed by subsequent workflow steps.
name: Docker

  push:
    tags:
      - '*' release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps:
    - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v2
Figure 8.1: .github/workflows/docker.yaml#1–15

The current Dockerfile does not appear to copy the .git/ folder to the image, meaning that this is not currently a security risk. However, if the Dockerfile is altered, credentials could be exposed in the Docker image.
We also observed that scroll-contracts/.github/workflows/docker-release.yml file references a Dockerfile that no longer exists in the repository, so it can be removed from the codebase.
Recommendations
Short term, add persist-credentials: false to checkout actions that do not require privileged Git operations.

B. Code Quality Findings
We identified the following code quality issues through manual and automatic code review.
These issues are not associated with any specific vulnerabilities. However, they will enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the future.
●​ Manual assert construction. The following if statement plus panic statement is equivalent to an assert statement. Use Clippy’s manual assert rule to find and fix all instances of this pattern in the codebase.
fn verify_commitments(commitment: &ProgramCommitment) { if commitment.exe != CHUNK_EXE_COMMIT { panic!(
            "mismatch chunk-proof exe commitment: expected={:?}, got={:?}",
            CHUNK_EXE_COMMIT, commitment.exe,
        );
    } if commitment.leaf != CHUNK_LEAF_COMMIT { panic!(
            "mismatch chunk-proof leaf commitment: expected={:?}, got={:?}",
            CHUNK_EXE_COMMIT, commitment.leaf,
        );
    }
}
Figure B.1: crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/circuit.rs#46–59
●​ Use of ok_or with function calls. Arguments passed to ok_or are eagerly evaluated and may lead to unnecessary computation. Since, in this case, a function is evaluated, we recommend using ok_or_else instead, as it will evaluate this function only if needed, preventing unnecessary computation. The codebase contains 16 instances of this pattern. Use Clippy’s or_fun_call rule to find and fix all instances of this pattern.
let sbv_chunk_info =
    SbvChunkInfo::from_blocks(chain_id, first_block.pre_state_root(),
&blocks);

let chain_spec = get_chain_spec(Chain::from_id(sbv_chunk_info.chain_id())).ok_or(
    Error::GenProof(format!("{err_prefix}: failed to get chain spec")),
)?;
Figure B.2: crates/prover/src/prover/chunk.rs#83–88
●​ Loop code could be simplified. Some loops explicitly call .iter() when this is not needed. Figure B.3 shows a case where the .iter() call can be removed. Use
Clippy’s explicit_iter_loop rule to find and fix all instances of this pattern.

for block in blocks.iter() { let output = ManuallyDrop::new(
        EvmExecutor::new(chain_spec.clone(), &db, block)
            .execute()
            .expect("failed to execute block"),
    ); db.update(&nodes_provider, output.state.state.iter())
        .expect("failed to update db");
}
Figure B.3: crates/circuits/chunk-circuit/src/execute.rs#56–64
●​ Incorrect documentation on the BatchHeaderV3Codec contract. The
BatchHeaderV3Codec contract has two instances of incorrect documentation. The lastBlockTimestamp documentation mentions the L1 skipped messages, and the storeBlobDataProof documentation refers the timestamp:
///   * lastBlockTimestamp      8           uint64      121     A bitmap to indicate which L1 messages are skipped in the batch
///   * blobDataProof           64          bytes64     129     The blob data proof: z (32), y (32)
Figure B.4: src/libraries/codec/BatchHeaderV3Codec.sol#17–18

/// @notice Store the last block timestamp of batch header.
/// @param batchPtr The start memory offset of the batch header in memory.
/// @param blobDataProof The blob data proof: z (32), y (32)
function storeBlobDataProof(uint256 batchPtr, bytes calldata blobDataProof)
internal pure {
Figure B.5: src/libraries/codec/BatchHeaderV3Codec.sol#66–69
●​ Imprecise documentation on the ScrollChain contract. The error is raised when the parent batch hash of the genesis block is non-zero, instead of the state zero:
/// @dev Thrown when the parent batch hash in genesis batch is zero.
error ErrorGenesisParentBatchHashIsNonZero();
Figure B.6: src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol#60–61
●​ Imprecise documentation of _loadBatchHeader. The documentation states that
_totalL1MessagesPoppedOverall is a parameter, but it is a return value.
/// @return _batchIndex The index of this batch.
/// @param _totalL1MessagesPoppedOverall The number of L1 messages popped after this batch.
function _loadBatchHeader(bytes calldata _batchHeader)
    internal view virtual

    returns ( uint256 batchPtr, bytes32 _batchHash, uint256 _batchIndex, uint256 _totalL1MessagesPoppedOverall
    )
Figure B.7: src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol#775–786
●​ Panic messages use incorrect data. The panic messages incorrectly reference
BATCH_EXE_COMMIT and CHUNK_EXE_COMMIT when compared against
BATCH_LEAF_COMMIT and CHUNK_LEAF_COMMIT.
if commitment.leaf != BATCH_LEAF_COMMIT { panic!(
        "mismatch batch-proof leaf commitment: expected={:?}, got={:?}",
        BATCH_EXE_COMMIT, commitment.leaf,
    );
}
Figure B.8: crates/circuits/bundle-circuit/src/circuit.rs#L85-L90 if commitment.leaf != CHUNK_LEAF_COMMIT { panic!(
        "mismatch chunk-proof leaf commitment: expected={:?}, got={:?}",
        CHUNK_EXE_COMMIT, commitment.leaf,
    );
}
Figure B.9: crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/circuit.rs#L53-L58
●​ Redundant batch index validation on the commitBatchWithBlobProof function. The commitBatchWithBlobProof function has a redundant check that batchIndex > euclidForkBatchIndex. The check appears to exist to allow committing v4 batches at an earlier index than the euclidForkBatchIndex (after this index has been set). However, given that batches need to be committed sequentially, it is not possible to commit a v4 batch before the already-committed v5 batch.
// Don't allow to commit version 4 after Euclid upgrade.
// This check is to avoid sequencer committing wrong batch due to human error.
// And This check won't introduce much gas overhead (likely less than 100).
if (_version == 4) { uint256 euclidForkBatchIndex = initialEuclidBatchIndex; if (euclidForkBatchIndex > 0 && batchIndex > euclidForkBatchIndex)
revert ErrorEuclidForkEnabled();
Figure B.10: src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol#319–324

●​ The parallel branch loadMPT could be simplified. The loadMPT function uses
​
        Trail of Bits​ 31​

        PUBLIC​
​

mutexes in parallel mode to ensure thread safety. However, the code used to ensure that threads are properly synchronized implicitly relies on checking a map entry to safely unlock a mutex without resulting in a runtime error when no parallelism is used. Although the code is correct, it could be easier to understand and review if the expected behavior is grouped in if branches depending on the parallelism mode.
for trieIt.Next() {
​ if parallel {
​
​ mptLeafMutex.Lock()
​
}

​ if _, ok := mptLeafMap[string(trieIt.Key)]; ok {
​
​ mptLeafMutex.Unlock()
​
​ break
​
}

​ mptLeafMap[string(dup(trieIt.Key))] = dup(trieIt.Value)

​ if parallel {
​
​ mptLeafMutex.Unlock()
​
}

​ if parallel && len(mptLeafMap)%10000 == 0 {
​
​ fmt.Println("MPT Accounts Loaded:", len(mptLeafMap))
​
}
}

C. Automated Analysis Tool Configuration
We used the following tools to perform automated testing of the codebase.
C.1. Clippy
The Rust linter Clippy can be installed using rustup by running the command rustup component add clippy. Invoking cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic in the root directory of the project runs the tool with the pedantic ruleset.
Clippy results from the regular set of rules should always be fixed.
# run clippy in regular and pedantic mode and output to SARIF cargo clippy --message-format=json | clippy-sarif > clippy.sarif cargo clippy --message-format=json -- -W clippy::pedantic -Wclippy::or_fun_call | clippy-sarif > clippy_pedantic.sarif
Figure C.1: The invocation commands used to run Clippy in the codebase
Converting the output to the SARIF file format (e.g., with clippy-sarif) allows easy inspection of the results within an IDE (e.g., using VSCode’s SARIF Explorer extension).
C.2. Dylint
Dylint is a tool for running Rust lints from dynamic libraries, similar to Clippy. We ran the general and supplementary rulesets against the codebase finding no relevant issues.
cargo dylint --no-deps --git https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint --pattern examples/general -- --message-format=json | clippy-sarif > general.sarif

cargo dylint --no-deps --git https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint --pattern examples/supplementary -- --message-format=json | clippy-sarif > supplementary.sarif
Figure C.2: The command used to run Dylint on the project
C.3. cargo-edit cargo-edit allows developers to quickly find outdated Rust crates. The tool can be installed with the cargo install cargo-edit command, and the cargo upgrade
--incompatible --dry-run command can be used to find outdated crates.
C.4. cargo-audit
The cargo-audit Cargo plugin identifies known vulnerable dependencies in Rust projects.
It can be installed using cargo install cargo-audit. To run the tool, run cargo audit in the crate root directory.

C.5. zizmor zizmor is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions. It can be installed using cargo install
--locked zizmor. We ran zizmor with the following commands:
zizmor . --format sarif > zizmor.sarif zizmor --persona pedantic . --format sarif > zizmor_pedantic.sarif
Figure C.3: Commands used to run zizmor and output to SARIF

C.6. CodeQL
We analyzed the Go codebase with public and Trail of Bits private CodeQL queries.
# Create the go database codeql database create codeql.db --language=go

# Run all go queries codeql database analyze codeql.db --additional-packs ~/.codeql/codeql-repo
--format=sarif-latest --output=codeql_tob_all.sarif -- tob-go-all

Detailed Fix Review Results
TOB-SCREUC-1: The aggregation circuit does not validate the size of inner proofs
Resolved in PR#85 by using the zip_eq iterator, which checks that its inputs have the same length.
TOB-SCREUC-2: Insufficient validation of chunk information and blob bytes in the batch circuit validate
Resolved in PR#85 by using the zip_eq iterator, which checks that its inputs have the same length.
TOB-SCREUC-3: MPT migration code does not have unit tests
Unresolved. The Scroll team decided not to add any unit tests to the migration code, providing the following context:
[...] while we consider the current manual testing sufficient, we will consider adding additional unit tests before the upgrade.
TOB-SCREUC-4: Incorrect data present on BundleInfo
Resolved in the 51847 commit by setting the public input to the correct value.
TOB-SCREUC-5: Lax parsing of chunk data payload
Resolved in commits 9d9ed and c58cc by ensuring that the unused chunk lengths are always zero.
TOB-SCREUC-6: Docker release action is vulnerable to cache poisoning
Resolved in PR#1137 and PR#83 by disabling binary cache persistence in release GitHub actions.
TOB-SCREUC-7: Unpinned external GitHub CI/CD action versions
Resolved in PR#1138 and PR#84 by pinning all GitHub action versions to hashes, except those from the actions repository (e.g., actions/checkout).
TOB-SCREUC-8: Potential credential persistence in artifacts and stale GitHub action
Resolved in PR#1139 and PR#85 by disabling credential persistence when calling the actions/checkout GitHub action.
