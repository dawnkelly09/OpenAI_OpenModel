Executive Summary
Engagement Overview
Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of ArbOS 40, specifically the commits df1fe56 and b3dd979 of the Nitro repo and commits 084f638 and 2a0b8b of
ArbOS’s go-ethereum fork.
Additionally, we also reviewed Nitro and Arbitrum’s geth fork (PR#444, PR#3129, and
PR#3132), as well as PR#6 of sys-asm.
A team of three consultants conducted the review from April 7, 2025, to May 2, 2025, for a total of 11 engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the target, using automated and manual processes.
Observations and Impact
The security assessment focused on evaluating ArbOS v40, which mainly includes changes to support the Pectra Hardfork, merging previous go-ethereum versions into Arbitrum’s own fork, and other miscellaneous changes.
The review’s main focus was on EIP implementations, precompiles, and the state transition function, as well as on looking for code changes that could potentially be non-backwards compatible or lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, we reviewed adjacent code (i.e.
code that is not part of the state transition function or the replay binary)  that also received changes.
We found one high-severity issue related to EIP-2935 block hash updates and five informational findings. Most issues relate to EIP implementation divergences between
Arbitrum and Ethereum. We recommend enhancing the documentation to highlight
Arbitrum-specific behaviors.
Recommendations
We recommend addressing the high-severity EIP-2935 implementation issue prior to the
ArbOS 40 release. For future protocol upgrades, we suggest developing comprehensive EIP compatibility test suites that specifically validate differences between L1 and L2 implementations. Additionally, we recommend enhancing documentation around
Arbitrum-specific behaviors.
Review the items in the Code Quality Recommendation appendix and consider taking actions on each one.

Detailed Findings 1. Arbitrum precompiles break EIP-7702 contract delegation behavior due to non-empty code
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: Low
Type: Undefined Behavior
Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS40-1
Target: go-ethereum/core/vm/evm.go

Description
EIP-7702 specifies that when a contract delegation points to a precompile address, the call should succeed without execution:
“In case a delegation designator points to a precompile address, retrieved code is considered empty and CALL, CALLCODE, STATICCALL, DELEGATECALL instructions targeting this account will execute empty code, i.e. succeed with no execution given enough gas.”
However, Arbitrum’s implementation does not follow this behavior because its precompiles contain 0xFE (INVALID opcode) instead of empty code.
for addr, version := range PrecompileMinArbOSVersions {
​ if version == nextArbosVersion {
​
​ stateDB.SetCode(addr, []byte{byte(vm.INVALID)})
​
}
}
Figure 1.1: Snippet of the UpgradeArbosVersion function
(arbos/arbosState/arbosstate.go#L358-L362)
When a contract delegates to a precompile, the resolveCode function returns this non-empty code.
if target, ok := types.ParseDelegation(code); ok {
​
// Note we only follow one level of delegation.
​ return evm.StateDB.GetCode(target)
}

​

​

This causes the EVM interpreter to attempt execution of the INVALID opcode rather than treating it as a successful no-op operation, as required by the EIP.
Recommendations
Short term, implement the behavior defined in EIP-7702 when delegating to a precompile, even for Arbitrum precompiles, or accurately document the different behavior.
Long-term, when implementing EIPs, carefully evaluate how Arbitrum’s distinct behavior compared to Ethereum may impact these implementations.

2. Missing deployment of EIP-2935 contract required for Pectra hard fork compatibility
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: Low
Type: Configuration
Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS40-2
Target: arbos/*

Description
The contract required by EIP-2935 (the block hash history contract) has not been deployed.
This contract is a necessary component for full Pectra compatibility, as it provides access to historical block hashes beyond the standard 256-block window. Without this deployment,
Arbitrum will not fully support the historical block hash functionality introduced in the
Pectra hard fork.
Recommendations
Short term, deploy the EIP-2935 contract before upgrading to ArbOS 40 to ensure full compatibility with the Pectra hard fork features.
Long term, establish a pre-upgrade checklist that verifies all required contract deployments and configurations for each Ethereum protocol upgrade, including validation of all dependent EIPs to ensure complete compatibility with Ethereum's protocol evolution.
Notes
This issue was addressed by PR#3129.

3. Misleading comment in StylusParams storage handler could lead to data corruption
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: Low
Type: Documentation
Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS40-3
Target: arbos/programs/params.go

Description
The comment “order matters!” in the Params and Save functions does not immediately convey what it is referring to. By simply examining the code that follows the comment in the Params function, one may assume that it refers to the order of the members of the
StylusParams struct; however, it actually refers to the order in which the take closure is used.
In this case, the closure reads encoded values from storage. This means that it is of the utmost importance that the values are consistently read in the same order across code updates; otherwise, a different result will be returned.
Because the comment is not immediately clear, a developer could inadvertently change the order in which the storage is read and written to, potentially causing data corruption on writes or incorrect reads.
// order matters!
stylusParams := &StylusParams{
​ backingStorage:   sto,
​ arbosVersion:     p.ArbosVersion,
​

(audit-arbitrum-nitro/arbos/programs/params.go#84–102)
Recommendations
Short term, rewrite the comments  in the Params and Save functions to clarify what they are referring to.
Long term, ensure that all critical comments throughout the codebase are explicit enough for anyone to understand them.

4. EIP-2935 block hash contract implementation can be optimized
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: Low
Type: Configuration
Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS40-4
Target: src/execution_hash/main.eas

Description
The EIP-2935 block hash history contract implementation unnecessarily calls the expensive
%arb_block_num macro twice, increasing gas costs.
This implementation differs from the standard Ethereum version because it uses an
ArbSys call to retrieve the block number rather than the native blocknumber opcode, making each call more expensive as it requires an additional contract call. This change is necessary because the blocknumber opcode does not behave the same as in Ethereum, so the contract needs to be adjusted to provide the expected outcome.
;; Check if input is requesting a block hash greater than current block number
;; minus 1.
push 0            ;; [0]
calldataload      ;; [input]
push 1            ;; [1, input]
%arb_block_num    ;; [number, 1, input]
sub               ;; [number-1, input]
dup2              ;; [input, number-1, input]
gt                ;; [input > number-1, input]
jumpi @throw      ;; [input]

;; Check if the input is requesting a block hash before the earliest available
;; hash currently. Since we've verified that input <= number - 1, we know
;; there will be no overflow during the subtraction of number - input.
push BUFLEN       ;; [buflen, input]
dup2              ;; [input, buflen, input]
%arb_block_num    ;; [number, input, buflen, input]
sub               ;; [number - input, buflen, input]
gt                ;; [number - input > buflen, input]
jumpi @throw      ;; [input]

Recommendations
Short term, optimize the code by storing the result of the first %arb_block_num call on the stack using dup/swap operations and reusing it for the second occurrence.
If the code is indeed changed, then update the relevant Nitro bytecode for the system contract.
Notes
This issue was addressed by PR#6. Note that the bytecode still needs to be updated in
Nitro.

5. Potential error handling issue in Code retrieval after interface change
Severity: Informational
Difficulty: High
Type: Error Reporting
Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS40-5
Target: arbos/programs/programs.go

Description
The transition in this commit from using ContractCodeWithPrefix to Code in the
SetProgramCached function introduces a potential error handling issue. The new Code function does not return an error for empty code, unlike the previous implementation, which could lead to silent failures when caching programs.
// Not passing in an address is supported pre-Verkle, as in Blockchain's
ContractCodeWithPrefix method.
code, err := db.Reader().Code(common.Address{}, codeHash)
if err != nil {
​ return err
}
Figure 5.1: The new Code function does not return an error for empty code
(nitro/arbos/programs/programs.go#452–455)
The new interface was introduced by go-ethereum in PR#30816, which highlights the code semantics change:
“Notably, this interface modifies the function’s semantics. If the contract code is not found, no error will be returned. An error should only be returned in the event of an unexpected issue, primarily for future implementations.”
Recommendations
Short term, add a check for empty code after calling db.Reader().Code and return an error if no code is found.
Long term, carefully review go-ethereum function semantic changes for potential impacts on Arbitrum’s implementation when integrating go-ethereum changes into the Arbitrum fork.

6. EIP-2935 block hash history update function is not called, breaking historical block hash access
Severity: High
Difficulty: Low
Type: Configuration
Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS40-6
Target: arbos/state_processor.go

Description
The Arbitrum implementation fails to call the ProcessParentBlockHash function required by EIP-2935 (Block Hash History).
The function is defined in go-ethereum but never called in ArbOS. This is because in geth, it is called in the Process function that processes new blocks (figure 6.1), while ArbOS uses its own ProduceBlock function. This prevents the block hash history contract from being updated with each new block. All calls to retrieve historical block hashes will fail after the
Pectra hard fork.
if p.config.IsPrague(block.Number(), block.Time(), context.ArbOSVersion) || p.config.IsVerkle(block.Number(), block.Time()) {
​
ProcessParentBlockHash(block.ParentHash(), evm)
}
Figure 6.1: ProcessParentBlockHash is called by the Process function in Arbitrum’s Geth fork, but is not in ArbOS (go-ethereum/core/state_processor.go#88–90)
Exploit Scenario
A cross-chain bridge contract relies on historical block hash validation beyond the standard 256-block window. After the Pectra hard fork, the bridge tries to access an older block hash using the EIP-2935 mechanism, but since the history contract has not been updated, the call returns incorrect data.
Recommendations
Short term, modify the ApplyInternalTxUpdate function to call
ProcessParentBlockHash when handling the InternalTxStartBlockMethodID case to ensure that the history contract is updated with each new block.
Long term, enhance integration testing when merging geth upstream changes to verify that the system works as expected, and expand tests to validate new behavior, such as validating that the EIP-2935 functionality works as intended.

B. Code Quality Findings
The following findings are not associated with any specific vulnerabilities. However, fixing them will enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the future.
●​ The maxWasmSize parameter (type uint32) is cast to int in getWasmFromContractCode in the following location. This issue could cause an integer overflow on 32-bit systems where int is 32 bits. Values greater than 231-1 would become negative, potentially causing unexpected behavior when passed to
DecompressWithDictionary. While Arbitrum Nitro likely runs only on 64-bit systems, this issue could cause problems if the code were ever to run on 32-bit architectures.
○​ arbos/programs/programs.go#L317
●​ The Reorg function is not documented. We recommend documenting this function, particularly how it is meant to be used and why it supports reorging past a finalized block.
●​ There is a typo in the error message of the Compress function. The message should say failed compression instead of failed decompression.
○​ arbcompress/native.go#L45
