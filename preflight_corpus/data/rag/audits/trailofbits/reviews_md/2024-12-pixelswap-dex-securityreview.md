‭Executive Summary‬
‭Engagement Overview‬
‭PixelSwap Labs Ltd. engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of PixelSwap DEX smart‬
‭contracts. The PixelSwap DEX is a constant-product-formula-based decentralized exchange‬
‭developed in the Tact language to be deployed on the TON blockchain network.‬
‭A team of two consultants conducted the review from June 24 to July 16, 2024, for a total of‬
‭six engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on‬‭finding issues impacting the‬
‭availability and integrity of the target system‬‭. With‬‭full access to source code and‬
‭documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the target smart contracts‬
‭using automated and manual processes.‬‭The off-chain‬‭software components used by the‬
‭system were not in scope for this review.‬
‭Observations and Impact‬
‭The PixelSwap DEX smart contracts are divided into well-defined components, both to keep‬
‭track of user balances and pair reserves and to keep these different balances in sync in the‬
‭limited smart contract execution environment of the TON blockchain network. However,‬
‭the complex message-passing flow and error-handling mechanisms make it difficult to‬
‭follow the code paths and to understand the security properties of all system components.‬
‭During the review, we found multiple high-severity issues arising from a lack of user data‬
‭validation that enable theft of user deposits (‬‭TOB-PXL-3‬‭,‬‭TOB-PXL-6‬‭, and‬‭TOB-PXL-13‬‭). We‬
‭also found a high-severity issue,‬‭TOB-PXL-11‬‭, related‬‭to the wrong compilation of a return‬
‭value from a recursive call function.‬
‭Some issues, such as‬‭TOB-PXL-1‬‭,‬‭TOB-PXL-2‬‭,‬‭TOB-PXL-7‬‭,‬‭TOB-PXL-8‬‭, and‬‭TOB-PXL-9‬‭, are‬
‭logic bugs that highlight the test suite’s low coverage. Other issues are related to incorrect‬
‭settlement vault balance tracking, incorrect gas checks, incorrect gas value computation,‬
‭inconsistent message formatting, and the use of an incorrect formula.‬
‭We also noted that the settlement vault balance functionality is incomplete and is not used‬
‭to validate balance transfers between funding and execution contracts.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security‬
‭review, Trail of Bits recommends that the PixelSwap Labs Ltd. team take the following steps‬
‭prior to the production deployment:‬
‭●‬ ‭Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.‬‭Various‬‭issues allow attackers to‬
‭drain all the assets from the protocol smart contracts. These findings should be‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭6‬

‭addressed as part of direct remediation or as part of any refactoring that may occur‬
‭when addressing other recommendations.‬
‭●‬ ‭Reduce the codebase complexity.‬‭Break the messages‬‭and functions to handle‬
‭different types of assets and operations to reduce the complexity of the codebase.‬
‭●‬ ‭Document and follow a strategy for gas checks and computations.‬‭Develop a‬
‭strategy for calculating gas check parameters and the remaining gas value,‬
‭document this strategy, and follow it for all the functions of the smart contracts.‬
‭●‬ ‭Document the message and asset flow through the system.‬‭Create diagrams for‬
‭all of the message and asset flow paths through the smart contracts to identify‬
‭points of failure and the reachability of an inconsistent state. Document‬
‭assumptions of all the user interactions with the smart contracts and validate their‬
‭correctness to find possible malicious inputs.‬
‭●‬ ‭Expand and improve the test suite.‬‭Tests should cover‬‭edge cases and‬
‭unexpected inputs. Check all of the state updates in the test cases to avoid a false‬
‭sense of security from incorrect or incomplete test cases. Ensure that the TON‬
‭balance of the system smart contracts does not go down after a user interaction to‬
‭maintain a healthy TON balance for storage rent. See‬‭appendix E‬‭for more‬
‭information.‬

‭Project Goals‬
‭The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the PixelSwap DEX.‬
‭Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:‬
‭●‬ ‭Are the access controls correctly implemented? Can a non-privileged account gain‬
‭access to privileged functionality?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are messages correctly handled? How are complex structures decoded? Is it‬
‭possible for malformed data to be decoded incorrectly, permanently affecting the‬
‭system?‬
‭●‬ ‭Is it possible for a user to access funds that do not belong to them? Is it possible to‬
‭drain a contract or otherwise get funds stuck in a contract?‬
‭●‬ ‭Can a malicious actor modify internal accounting? Can they affect third parties’‬
‭interactions with the contracts?‬
‭●‬ ‭Do all contracts handle AFR and bounced messages as expected? Is it possible for a‬
‭malicious actor to forge AFR messages?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are the contract state variables correctly initialized, and their values correctly‬
‭modified during the contract’s lifetime?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are the DEX swap and liquidity provider token minting equations correctly‬
‭implemented? Could malicious actors gain value in a swap, or receive more LP‬
‭tokens than the value added?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are all fund flows considered for adding or removing liquidity? Can funds become‬
‭lost in any DEX operations?‬
‭●‬ ‭Do tests reflect real-life situations? Do the tests fail to consider any user flows?‬
‭●‬ ‭Is the system implementing standards (such as TEP-74) correctly? Can any‬
‭standard-compliant contract interact with the PixelSwap DEX and expect standard‬
‭behavior?‬

‭Project Coverage‬
‭This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by‬
‭our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:‬
‭●‬ ‭The scope for the current audit included the following files:‬
‭○‬ ‭contracts/pixelswap_funding.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭contracts/pixelswap_messages.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭contracts/pixelswap_settlement.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭contracts/pixelswap_streampool.tact‬

‭○‬ ‭contracts/utils/pausable_single_role.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭contracts/utils/time.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭contracts/jetton/jetton_factory.tact‬
‭●‬ ‭We understood and reviewed the full flow of messages and funds from the user‬
‭TON or Jetton wallet to the funding wallet, funding master contract, settlement‬
‭contract, and Stream Pool contract. This included the data validation in each step,‬
‭the AFR message flows, and the potential state reversions.‬
‭●‬ ‭We covered the integrations with the TEP-74 Jetton standard. This included‬
‭reviewing the external message handlers for Jetton messages, data validation steps‬
‭to keep track of balances, and AFR handlers for state reversion.‬
‭●‬ ‭We reviewed the implementation of the TEP-74 standard for the LP tokens in the‬
‭Jetton Factory trait contract.‬
‭●‬ ‭We reviewed the message handlers for all contracts. These handlers are public‬
‭entrypoints that any user can interact with. We reviewed access controls, gas and‬
‭value calculations, and data validation for incoming messages.‬
‭●‬ ‭We reviewed the internal functionality of the funding wallet, funding master,‬
‭settlement, and Stream Pool contracts. This includes the internal calculation‬
‭functions for adding and removing liquidity and performing swaps in the Stream‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭10‬

‭Pool contract, depositing and withdrawing assets in the settlement contract, and the‬
‭interactions between users and the funding contracts.‬
‭Coverage Limitations‬
‭Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage‬
‭limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and‬
‭indicates system elements that may warrant further review:‬
‭●‬ ‭Given the complexity of the system and the number of issues found during the‬
‭audit, we believe that additional time for the engagement would have improved our‬
‭coverage of the items listed below. It also could have increased our understanding‬
‭and testing of the codebase, potentially leading to discovery of more issues.‬
‭●‬ ‭We did not cover the‬‭oracle.tact‬‭and‬‭oracle_data.tact‬‭contracts since they‬
‭were not used anywhere in the PixelSwap DEX. Instead, we focused on currently‬
‭implemented functionality to maximize our understanding of the system.‬
‭●‬ ‭We did not cover the following libraries and utilities:‬
‭○‬ ‭fixed_point.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭math.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭weighted_math.tact‬
‭○‬ ‭FunC files, such as‬‭mathlib.fc‬‭,‬‭extra.fc‬
‭●‬ ‭All interactions, tests, and flows related to the Stream Pool contract were made with‬
‭a single actor, and no simultaneous transactions from multiple senders or actors‬
‭were tested. Additional testing should be performed to ensure that concurrent‬
‭interactions do not put the system in an inconsistent state.‬
‭●‬ ‭We did review the gas calculations, but given the complexity of the interactions and‬
‭the number of code paths that could use gas to receive, process, or send messages‬
‭in an asynchronous manner, we cannot assure that the calculation results are‬
‭correct for every potential case. Even though we found issues related to gas‬
‭calculations (such as‬‭TOB-PXL-7‬‭,‬‭TOB-PXL-20‬‭, and‬‭TOB-PXL-23‬‭),‬‭we recommend‬
‭improving the test suite to cover all possible execution paths in the contracts and‬
‭measure the gas usage for each particular case.‬
‭●‬ ‭We did not test the system for malformed input messages. We considered that‬
‭attacker messages could have incorrect or deliberately malicious data, but not the‬
‭cases where the data is corrupt or cannot be parsed by the receiving contract. These‬
‭cases should be tested in the unit tests focusing on the data parsing functions.‬

‭Codebase Maturity Evaluation‬
‭Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of‬
‭the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies‬
‭identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that‬
‭should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,‬
‭functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.‬
‭Category‬
‭Summary‬
‭Result‬
‭Arithmetic‬
‭The codebase uses arithmetic operations to calculate the‬
‭amount out for swaps, the amount of LP tokens to mint,‬
‭the amount of tokens to transfer on removing liquidity,‬
‭and new reserves of the pool on every user action. These‬
‭operations follow the correct rounding direction to‬
‭benefit the protocol.‬
‭However, the system parameters are not bounded, and‬
‭their impact has not been documented. We also found‬
‭an issue related to using the wrong formula‬
‭(‬‭TOB-PXL-10‬‭). The test suite does not cover several‬
‭arithmetic edge cases.‬
‭Weak‬
‭Auditing‬
‭Most of the state-changing functions in the contracts‬
‭emit events for off-chain monitoring. However, there is‬
‭no specific documentation describing the events, their‬
‭types, and the requirements for emission.‬
‭We were not informed about any incident monitoring‬
‭system or incident response plan.‬
‭Regarding events, there is a name duplication issue‬
‭between the‬‭TokenBalanceChangeEvent‬‭in the funding‬
‭and the settlement contract. Some events have specific‬
‭message types, and other events just reuse existing‬
‭incoming messages and forward them. Given the issues‬
‭described, no naming convention is in place.‬
‭Refer to‬‭appendix C‬‭for more information about code‬
‭quality issues and‬‭appendix D‬‭for recommendations‬‭on‬
‭designing and implementing an incident response plan.‬
‭Moderate‬
‭Authentication /‬
‭The system implements only a few access control roles‬
‭Moderate‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭12‬

‭Access Controls‬
‭for privileged functions following‬‭the principle of least‬
‭privilege‬‭. It is mentioned that certain privileged‬‭roles are‬
‭meant to be bound to a hardware wallet or‬
‭multisignature wallet, but it is not possible for us to verify‬
‭these claims.‬
‭Crucial privileged operations implement a two-step‬
‭process; however, the existing test suite does not cover‬
‭the access controls of all the privileged functions or the‬
‭functionality for granting and revoking roles.‬
‭The system can benefit from additional documentation‬
‭specifying which actors are granted roles, their privileges,‬
‭and the process of granting and revoking roles in the‬
‭system.‬
‭Complexity‬
‭Management‬
‭The codebase includes unnecessary complexity that‬
‭hinders automated and manual review. The functions‬
‭overuse nested operations such as conditionals,‬
‭exceptions, or recursive calls with complex return values.‬
‭A single‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message is used to implement all‬
‭the core functionality of the system, which makes it‬
‭difficult to follow the code and asset flow and introduces‬
‭several security issues related to invalid user inputs.‬
‭Using different parameters for gas checks and remaining‬
‭gas computation also introduces unnecessary‬
‭complexity.‬
‭The codebase can benefit from the use of different‬
‭messages to transfer TON and Jetton, swap and‬
‭add/remove liquidity, and break messages and functions‬
‭to be more granular in general.‬
‭There are several instances of code duplication or code‬
‭blocks that could be extracted into functions. This makes‬
‭the codebase more difficult to read and can introduce‬
‭bugs in certain situations, for example, when only one‬
‭instance of the duplicated code is modified. Refer to‬
‭appendix C‬‭for more information.‬
‭Weak‬
‭Decentralization‬
‭The project implements a decentralized exchange (DEX)‬
‭in the TON network. However, it is not fully decentralized.‬
‭All privileged operations are managed by the PixelSwap‬
‭Labs team, either by hardware wallet accounts or‬
‭Weak‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭13‬

‭multisignature wallets, as stated in the documentation.‬
‭Additionally, these changes do not implement a timelock‬
‭feature to allow users to opt out of these changes.‬
‭There is no mention of a decentralized governance‬
‭system to be implemented. System configuration‬
‭parameters (such as adding funding or execution‬
‭contracts or changing gas configuration) can only be‬
‭changed by the owners.‬
‭Documentation‬
‭The documentation is a multi-level specification of the‬
‭important components. The codebase includes inline and‬
‭NatSpec comments, and there is consistency across all‬
‭documentation.‬
‭Some inline comments are wrong and outdated.‬
‭Additional documentation on the selection of gas‬
‭parameters and gas value arithmetic is required to‬
‭facilitate the computation of the correct gas parameters‬
‭to ensure the execution of full message flow and‬
‭maintain a stable system state.‬
‭Moderate‬
‭Low-Level‬
‭Manipulation‬
‭From a Tact language point of view, the usage of raw‬
‭FunC or assembly code can be considered low-level.‬
‭In the PixelSwap codebase, multiple low-level libraries‬
‭are used for basic TON functionality, such as‬‭stdlib.fc‬‭,‬
‭math calculations, or a standard-compliant Jetton wallet‬
‭library in FunC.‬
‭As stated in this report’s Project Coverage section, the‬
‭low-level files were considered out of scope, and we‬
‭recommend further analysis and testing for these‬
‭libraries.‬
‭Further‬
‭Investigation‬
‭Required‬
‭Testing and‬
‭Verification‬
‭The existing test suite includes unit tests for most of the‬
‭functionality, but the test cases focus on the “happy path”‬
‭and do not cover edge cases, adversarial user input, or‬
‭failure cases. The internal transfer test cases fail.‬
‭Additionally, several test cases do not check the resulting‬
‭state sufficiently to ensure the correctness of the smart‬
‭contract storage updates. There are no tests verifying the‬
‭correct emission of events (external messages).‬
‭Weak‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭14‬

‭The target version of the codebase is still under‬
‭development, as evident from all the commented-out‬
‭code in the contracts and functions, the debug “dump”‬
‭statements, and the undocumented code.‬
‭We recommend cleaning up the codebase, expanding the‬
‭test suite’s coverage and edge cases, and implementing‬
‭additional test strategies such as fuzzing or end-to-end‬
‭integration testing before the codebase is deployed and‬
‭published. The test suite should be run in the CI/CD‬
‭pipeline to detect bugs as early as possible.‬
‭Transaction‬
‭Ordering‬
‭We did not perform any tests on the codebase regarding‬
‭transaction ordering risks.‬
‭Since the TON network is asynchronous by design, the‬
‭order in which messages are processed is not known‬
‭from outside the chain, and it can be challenging to‬
‭configure a specific order of processing for network‬
‭messages.‬
‭Further‬
‭Investigation‬

‭1. The BulkInternalTransfer receiver computes the wrong total amounts‬

‭Type: Data Validation‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-PXL-1‬
‭Target:‬‭contracts/pixelswap_funding.tact‬
‭Description‬
‭The‬‭BulkInternalTransfer‬‭receiver function of the‬‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬
‭contract computes the wrong total amounts to spend by adding the amount of the first‬
‭entry multiple times.‬
‭In the‬‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬‭contract, when a‬‭BulkInternalTransfer‬‭message is‬
‭processed, a loop calculates the total amount of tokens to be spent from the wallet.‬
‭However, the loop does not increase the index variable‬‭i‬‭, so the result values will be the‬
‭amounts for the first entry times the total number of entries.‬
‭Consequently, when the‬‭spend_wallet‬‭internal function‬‭is called, an incorrect balance will‬
‭be deducted, or a panic will be raised if the balance is insufficient.‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭Additionally, the loop in the receiver for‬‭BulkInternalTransfer‬‭in the‬
‭PixelswapFunding‬‭contract is correctly implemented,‬‭which can result in the sum of user‬
‭balances not matching the balance of the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract, allowing users‬
‭to withdraw more than they own and incorrectly decreasing the balance of the sender.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Bob sends a‬‭BulkInternalTransfer‬‭message with three‬‭entries, the first of which has 0‬
‭token_amt‬‭and 0‬‭ton_amt‬‭. Bob’s funding wallet spends‬‭0 of his tokens, but the master‬
‭funding contract correctly adds funds to the receivers’ wallets. Bob is able to withdraw‬
‭funds that do not belong to him from the funding contract.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, increment the index variable‬‭i‬‭in the loop.‬
‭In the long term, expand the test suite to implement test cases for bulk transfers and‬
‭ensure that these tests also consider malicious inputs.‬

‭Description‬
‭Granting the privileged role to the‬‭PixelswapFunding‬‭contract on a user-owned‬
‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬‭contract will result in the‬‭user balance being spent even if the‬
‭user is the recipient of the‬‭InternalTransfer‬‭message.‬‭This can drain the user’s balance‬
‭by repeatedly forwarding the‬‭InternalTransfer‬‭message‬‭between the funding wallet‬
‭and the master contract.‬
‭Users have funding wallets to interact with the system. In these wallets, they are both‬
‭owners and privileged users (they have a privileged role). Any user can grant the privileged‬
‭role to an address on their funding wallets via the‬‭GrantRole‬‭message of the access‬
‭control trait, as shown in figure 2.1:‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭If a user grants the privileged role to the master funding contract, then the‬
‭InternalTransfer‬‭message receiver function will always‬‭execute the first‬‭if‬‭block for‬
‭the messages sent from the master funding contract, as shown in figure 2.2:‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭This will spend the user’s balance instead of adding funds to the user’s wallet and send the‬
‭same message to the master funding contract, which will then send it back to the user’s‬
‭funding wallet contract, and it will keep spending the user’s balance repeatedly until the‬
‭gas sent with the message is consumed.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Alice accidentally grants the privileged role to the master funding contract on her funding‬
‭wallet. From then on, any internal transfer she receives will not be accrued to her wallet‬
‭and will drain her wallet balance.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭20‬

‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, review the order in which the checks are performed to ensure that even if the‬
‭funding contract is privileged, it does not affect the expected outcome of the process. Also,‬
‭consider limiting accounts that can get privileged roles in each system contract.‬
‭Long term, identify and document all possible actions that privileged accounts can take,‬
‭along with their associated risks. This will facilitate codebase reviews and prevent future‬
‭mistakes.‬

‭3. Users can inflate their funding wallet balance by sending an expired‬‭Swap‬

‭Description‬
‭Users can inflate their funding wallet balance of any token by sending a‬‭Swap‬‭message that‬
‭will trigger a failure reply message from the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract. Users can‬
‭use this to drain the settlement contract.‬
‭There are two ways to initiate a swap in the system: sending a‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message to the‬
‭user’s funding wallet and sending a‬‭Swap‬‭message to‬‭the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract.‬
‭The‬‭Swap‬‭message to the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract‬‭has an‬‭extra_tokens‬‭field.‬
‭The‬‭token_gas‬‭and‬‭token_forward_milliton‬‭fields of‬‭the‬‭extra_tokens‬‭structure are‬
‭used to calculate the required gas amount and to decide if the output tokens should be‬
‭added to the user’s funding wallet or sent to the user’s external wallet. All other fields of‬
‭the‬‭extra_tokens‬‭values are ignored in the‬‭Swap‬‭message‬‭receiver function of the‬
‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract. The‬‭Swap‬‭receiver of‬‭the settlement contract then‬
‭creates a‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message and sends it to the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract for‬
‭execution.‬
‭If the‬‭place_order‬‭internal function of the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract detects a‬
‭failure case, it sends the‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message back‬‭to the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬
‭contract as a failure reply message. The settlement contract then forwards it to the‬
‭PixelswapFunding‬‭contract, which forwards it to the‬‭user’s‬‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬
‭contract.‬
‭The‬‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬‭then processes the‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message as unspent‬
‭order, as shown in figure 3.1:‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭However, the‬‭unspent_order_inputs‬‭function of the‬‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬
‭contract assumes that the tokens included in the‬‭extra_tokens‬‭field were spent from the‬
‭user’s wallet if the‬‭token_is_input‬‭is set to‬‭true‬‭and adds these tokens to the user’s‬
‭balance, while the input tokens in the‬‭extra_tokens‬‭are not spent from the user’s funding‬
‭wallet if they initiate the swap by sending a‬‭Swap‬‭message to the settlement contract.‬

‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Eve sends an expired‬‭Swap‬‭message with an‬‭extra_tokens‬‭field containing a‬‭TokenInfo‬
‭for 1,000 USDT tokens with the‬‭token_is_input‬‭variable‬‭set to‬‭true‬‭. This message‬
‭triggers a failure reply message from the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract, which is‬
‭forwarded to Eve's funding wallet contract. The funding wallet contract adds 1,000 USDT to‬
‭her balance, assuming they were spent from her wallet to initiate the swap. Eve withdraws‬
‭these USDT tokens from her funding wallet and repeats this process to drain all the tokens‬
‭from the settlement contract.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, in the‬‭Swap‬‭message receiver of the settlement‬‭contract, check that the‬
‭extra_tokens‬‭field of the message does not include any input tokens.‬
‭Long term, document the message flow in both success and failure cases and write test‬

‭Target:‬‭contracts/pixelswap_settlement.tact‬
‭Description‬
‭The‬‭PlaceOrder_Partial_2‬‭message receiver function‬‭of the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬
‭contract is used to relay messages between the funding contract and execution contracts,‬
‭but it does not update the‬‭SettlementVault‬‭balances‬‭to reflect the transfer of funds‬
‭between funding and execution contracts.‬
‭When a user initiates an order from their funding wallet, the‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message is sent‬
‭from their funding wallet to the master funding contract, which sends the same message to‬
‭the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract. The settlement contract‬‭then fetches the execution‬
‭contract address from its storage and sends the‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message to the‬
‭PixelswapSteampool‬‭contract. However, the‬‭PlaceOrder_Partial_2‬‭message receiver‬
‭of the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract does not remove‬‭the input tokens from the‬
‭SettlementVault‬‭of the funding contract and does not‬‭add the same tokens to the‬
‭SettlementVault‬‭of the execution contract.‬
‭Similarly, when a failure message is sent from the execution contract to the settlement‬
‭contract, the‬‭PlaceOrder_Partial_2‬‭message receiver‬‭of the‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬
‭contract does not remove the input tokens from‬‭SettlementVault‬‭of the execution‬
‭contract and does not add the same tokens to the‬‭SettlementVault‬‭of the funding‬
‭contract before sending the message to the funding contract.‬
‭This results in an imbalance between the balances stored in the funding contracts,‬
‭settlement vaults, and reserves stored in the execution contracts.‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, add calls to the‬‭token_balance_add‬‭and‬‭token_balance_reduce‬‭internal‬
‭functions to correctly update the settlement vault balances of the funding and execution‬
‭contracts while processing the‬‭PlaceOrder_Partial_2‬‭message.‬

‭The owner of the‬‭PixelSwapStreamPool‬‭contracts can‬‭set the configuration parameters‬
‭for the pool and the gas to any value without limits. This can lead to broken functionality or‬
‭high TON spending for users in the pools until the values are fixed.‬
‭According to the documentation, the owner role belongs to a multisignature wallet, so it is‬
‭expected that prior to executing a configuration change, more than one actor will review‬
‭the transaction. Thus, using a multisignature wallet makes it difficult to set wrong‬
‭configuration values.‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Alice and Bob are signers for the 2-out-of-3 multisignature wallet that controls the‬
‭deployed‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract. Alice creates‬‭and signs a configuration change‬
‭transaction, accidentally setting the‬‭remove_liquidity‬‭gas configuration to an extremely‬
‭high value. Bob trusts Alice, so he signs the transaction without reviewing it. When it is‬
‭executed, users’ interactions are more expensive than expected.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, set some reasonable limits to the configuration parameters that can be set in‬
‭the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract.‬
‭Long term, document the expected values for each parameter and their safe ranges. Add‬
‭test cases for the configuration change functions.‬

‭However, the remove liquidity function computes the amount of tokens to transfer in‬
‭proportion to the LP tokens to burn with respect to the total supply of the LP tokens. This‬

‭contract of the pair's LP token instead of the Jetton wallet owned by itself. This results in‬
‭the LP tokens never being burned.‬
‭Users remove their liquidity by transferring their LP tokens to the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬

‭Finding ID: TOB-PXL-13‬
‭Target:‬‭contracts/pixelswap_streampool.tact‬
‭Description‬
‭The‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message receiver function of the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract does‬
‭not validate that the‬‭pair_id‬‭specified in the message‬‭corresponds to the‬‭token_id‬
‭values specified in the message. This allows users to provide arbitrary‬‭token_id‬‭values to‬
‭execute a swap or add liquidity to a pair without transferring the required tokens.‬
‭The protocol allows users to transfer their Jettons and execute a protocol action in a single‬
‭transaction by specifying order parameters in the‬‭forward_payload‬‭field of the‬‭transfer‬
‭message of the Jetton contract. The Jetton contract sends the‬‭OrderJettonNotification‬
‭message to the settlement contract, which adds a deposit to the user’s funding wallet,‬
‭executes a swap, or adds liquidity to the specified pair based on the‬‭forward_payload‬
‭value specified in the‬‭OrderJettonNotification‬‭message.‬
‭However, the‬‭OrderJettonNotification‬‭message receiver‬‭cannot verify that the‬
‭message is sent by the correct Jetton wallet contract and is not sent by a malicious actor; it‬
‭considers the sender as the‬‭token_id‬‭for the order‬‭to be executed. This allows users to‬
‭add a funding wallet balance for an arbitrary‬‭token_id‬‭,‬‭execute a swap without‬
‭transferring Jettons, and add liquidity to a pool without transferring Jettons by sending the‬
‭OrderJettonNotification‬‭message from an arbitrary‬‭address.‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭As a result, the‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message receiver function‬‭of the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬
‭contract does not check if the user-provided value of the‬‭pair_id‬‭field corresponds to the‬
‭token_id‬‭values provided in the‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message.‬‭This allows attackers to send the‬
‭OrderJettonNotification‬‭message from an arbitrary‬‭address to steal tokens from the‬
‭settlement contract.‬
‭Exploit Scenario 1‬
‭Eve sends an‬‭OrderJettonNotification‬‭message from‬‭her smart wallet to swap USDC‬
‭for TON from the TON/USDC pool. The order is executed successfully, and Eve gets free‬

‭The order is executed successfully, and Eve gets free TON from the settlement contract.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, validate that the‬‭pair_id‬‭specified in‬‭the‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message corresponds‬
‭to the provided‬‭token_id‬‭values to ensure correct token transfers before executing an‬

‭The message tools library implements helper functions to deal with message passing‬
‭between contracts. Some of these functions deal with messages that carry TON value, and‬
‭the caller can specify the amount of TON to send.‬
‭In two of these functions, there is no check to ensure that the value to be set is positive.‬
‭Given that the parameter is of type‬‭Int‬‭, it is possible‬‭to pass a negative value and break‬

‭Description‬
‭All message sending functions in the message tools library use the‬‭SendIgnoreErrors‬
‭mode. If the sender contract’s current TON balance is insufficient to send the specified‬
‭value, the message will not be sent and will be dropped silently in the action phase.‬
‭Consequently, funds can be lost, or the system state can become out of sync between‬
‭contracts.‬
‭This issue can be exploited in different ways, one of which is described in the Exploit‬
‭Scenario section below.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭In the settlement contract, when the‬‭token_id‬‭is the‬‭TON native asset, the‬‭send_tokens‬
‭function‬‭sends a token amount equal to the sum of‬‭the specified‬‭token_amt‬‭, the‬
‭forwarding gas, and the gas cost to pay for the transfer. However, it never checks that the‬
‭contract’s current balance exceeds the value to be sent.‬
‭This results in a loss of funds for the user, because the funding wallet’s TON balance has‬
‭already been reduced at this point.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, when dealing with TON amounts to be transferred in messages, first ensure‬
‭that the current contract’s balance is enough. In case of failure, notify the sender via AFR.‬
‭Long term, document all gas usages in the different message flows; ensure that the‬
‭contract balances cannot drop below a certain threshold; and implement tests that check‬
‭that the functionality of the system is not broken in low-balance situations.‬

‭nests both orders in a single‬‭PlaceOrder‬‭message,‬‭believing that the system will correctly‬
‭identify the execution contracts that must be called.‬‭The order executes successfully and‬
‭the resulting reserves of the TON/USDC pair will be incorrect since both orders were‬
‭processed by the TON/USDC pool execution contract.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, check that the‬‭exec_id‬‭value matches the‬‭current execution contract’s ID for‬

‭TON contracts, being a part of an asynchronous blockchain, can process messages in a‬

‭It is important to take into account the gas costs associated with executing functions or‬
‭sending messages to ensure that the contract’s final balance after execution does not drop‬
‭below a threshold. Otherwise, if the balance is zero, the contract cannot pay for storage‬
‭costs and can eventually be destroyed.‬
‭We noticed several places where the gas calculations were not correct or did not consider‬

‭requires being a privileged account, and the second one requires the sender to be enabled‬
‭for adding tokens and pairs, and also paying a creation fee intended to avoid spamming.‬
‭Since the privileged account does not require paying the fee or sending TON at all, it is‬
‭possible to drain the balance of the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract because the message‬
‭handler sends the fee to the recipient in all cases.‬
‭[Redacted]‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Alice, a privileged account in the Stream Pool contract, decides to add new tokens and‬

‭C. Code Quality Findings‬
‭This appendix contains findings that do not have immediate or obvious security‬
‭implications. However, they may facilitate exploit chains targeting other vulnerabilities,‬
‭become easily exploitable in future releases, or decrease code readability. We recommend‬
‭fixing the issues reported here.‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove unnecessary conditional in‬‭AccessControlSingleRole‬‭.‬‭The‬‭del()‬
‭function returns true or false depending on the existence of the value to be deleted.‬
‭●‬ ‭Use a more appropriate name for the‬‭IncreaseTokenBalance‬‭message.‬‭The‬
‭message is sent to the‬‭PixelswapSettlementVault‬‭contract‬‭for both‬‭increasing‬
‭and‬‭decreasing‬‭the token balance.‬
‭●‬ ‭Fix the comment in‬‭AccessControlSIngleRoleNonTransferrable‬‭.‬‭The trait‬
‭implements the owner role, which is not transferable.‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove the unused‬‭is_token_info‬‭variable.‬
‭●‬ ‭Avoid using magic constants.‬‭Literal values are set‬‭directly in code (e.g.,‬ ‭#1‬‭,‬‭#2‬‭,‬
‭#3‬‭,‬‭#4‬‭). This makes the functions harder to read,‬‭and more difficult to maintain in‬
‭case the requirements are updated.‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove useless code.‬‭The‬‭add_liquidity‬‭and‬‭remove_liquidity‬‭functions‬
‭calculate the amounts and fees using the‬‭calc_add_lp_*‬‭and‬‭calc_remove_lp‬
‭functions from‬‭univ2_math.tact‬‭. The math functions‬‭explicitly state that the fees‬
‭returned are always 0; however, the Stream Pool caller calculates protocol fees and‬
‭updates the‬‭fees_payable‬‭fields in the pair status.‬‭Besides having no effect, this‬
‭code increases the computation cost and makes the functions more complex to‬
‭understand.‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove duplicated code.‬‭There are some instances of‬‭duplicated code, or sections‬
‭of code that could be abstracted into separate functions to improve readability.‬
‭Some examples include‬‭#1‬‭,‬‭#2‬‭, and‬‭#3‬‭. Having duplicated‬‭code increases the‬
‭likelihood of adding bugs when only one of the instances is modified, and also‬
‭increases the complexity of the function, degrading readability.‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove debug calls and commented code statements.‬‭In several contracts,‬
‭most notably on‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭, there are a significant‬‭number of‬‭dump‬
‭calls, debug print calls, and code statements commented out. The debug statements‬
‭should be converted into tests, validating the state before and after the intended‬
‭calls.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬

‭D. Incident Response Recommendations‬
‭This section provides recommendations on formulating an incident response plan.‬
‭●‬ ‭Identify the parties (either specific people or roles) responsible for‬
‭implementing the mitigations when an issue occurs (e.g., deploying smart‬
‭contracts, pausing contracts, upgrading the front end, etc.).‬
‭●‬ ‭Document internal processes for addressing situations in which a deployed‬
‭remedy does not work or introduces a new bug.‬
‭○‬ ‭Consider documenting a plan of action for handling failed remediations.‬
‭●‬ ‭Clearly describe the intended contract deployment process.‬
‭●‬ ‭Outline the circumstances under which PixelSwap Labs will compensate users‬
‭affected by an issue (if any).‬
‭○‬ ‭Issues that warrant compensation could include an individual or aggregate‬
‭loss or a loss resulting from user error, a contract flaw, or a third-party‬
‭contract flaw.‬
‭●‬ ‭Document how the team plans to stay up to date on new issues that could‬
‭affect the system; awareness of such issues will inform future development‬
‭work and help the team secure the deployment toolchain and the external‬
‭on-chain and off-chain services that the system relies on.‬
‭○‬ ‭Identify sources of vulnerability news for each language and component‬
‭used in the system, and subscribe to updates from each source. Consider‬
‭creating a private Discord channel in which a bot will post the latest‬
‭vulnerability news; this will provide the team with a way to track all updates‬
‭in one place. Lastly, consider assigning certain team members to track news‬
‭about vulnerabilities in specific system components.‬
‭●‬ ‭Determine when the team will seek assistance from external parties (e.g.,‬
‭auditors, affected users, other protocol developers) and how it will onboard‬
‭them.‬
‭○‬ ‭Effective remediation of certain issues may require collaboration with‬
‭external parties.‬
‭●‬ ‭Define contract behavior that would be considered abnormal by off-chain‬
‭monitoring solutions.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭60‬

‭It is best practice to perform periodic dry runs of scenarios outlined in the incident‬
‭response plan to find omissions and opportunities for improvement and to develop‬
‭“muscle memory.” Additionally, document the frequency with which the team should‬
‭perform dry runs of various scenarios, and perform dry runs of more likely scenarios more‬
‭regularly. Create a template to be filled out with descriptions of any necessary‬
‭improvements after each dry run.‬

‭E. Testing Improvement Recommendations‬
‭This appendix aims to provide general recommendations on improving processes and‬
‭enhancing the quality of the PixelSwap DEX test suite.‬
‭Identified Testing Deficiencies‬
‭During the audit, we encountered a number of issues that could have been prevented or‬
‭minimized through better test practices and improved test coverage (e.g.,‬‭TOB-PXL-1‬‭,‬
‭TOB-PXL-3‬‭, and‬‭TOB-PXL-10‬‭, among others). We identified‬‭several deficiencies in the test‬
‭suite that could make further testing and development more difficult and thereby reduce‬
‭the likelihood that the test suite will find security issues:‬
‭●‬ ‭The test suite does not fully cover all of the contracts and functions in the codebase,‬
‭and it does not test for all edge cases.‬
‭●‬ ‭Multiple negative unit tests do not test for a specific failure case; instead, they will‬
‭pass on any failure inside the test body. This reduces confidence that the test suite‬
‭will catch test failures, makes tests and issues harder to triage and debug, and could‬
‭lead to false negatives.‬
‭●‬ ‭Tests do not check for event emission (external messages) or transaction results and‬
‭only rely on checking balances or balance deltas for specific accounts, ignoring other‬
‭relevant checks.‬
‭●‬ ‭The test directory lacks a coherent structure; all DEX unit tests are placed inside the‬
‭same file. This can make it difficult to identify which components and behaviors are‬
‭being tested, making it harder to onboard developers.‬
‭To address these deficiencies and improve the PixelSwap DEX’s test coverage and‬
‭processes, we recommend that the PixelSwap Labs team define a clear testing strategy and‬
‭create guidelines on how testing is performed in the codebase. Our general guidelines for‬
‭improving test suite quality are as follows:‬
‭1.‬ ‭Define a clear test directory structure.‬‭A clear directory‬‭structure helps organize‬
‭the work of multiple developers, makes it easier to identify which components and‬
‭behaviors are being tested, and gives insight into the overall test coverage.‬
‭2.‬ ‭Write a design specification of the system, its components, and its functions in‬
‭plain language.‬‭Defining a specification can allow‬‭the team to more easily detect‬
‭bugs and inconsistencies in the system, reduce the likelihood that future code‬
‭changes will introduce bugs, improve the maintainability of the system, and allow‬
‭the team to create a robust and holistic testing strategy.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭62‬

‭3.‬ ‭Use the function specifications to guide the creation of unit tests.‬‭Creating a‬
‭specification of all preconditions, postconditions, failure cases, entry points, and‬
‭execution paths for a function will make it easier to maintain high test coverage and‬
‭identify edge cases.‬
‭4.‬ ‭Use the interaction specifications to guide the creation of integration tests.‬‭An‬
‭interaction specification will make it easier to identify the interactions that need to‬
‭be tested and the external failure cases that need to be validated or guarded‬
‭against, and it will help identify issues related to access controls and external calls.‬
‭5.‬ ‭Use fork testing for integration testing with third-party smart contracts and to‬
‭ensure that the deployed system works as expected.‬‭Fork testing can be used to‬
‭test interactions between the protocol contracts and third-party smart contracts by‬
‭providing an environment that is as close to production as possible. Additionally,‬
‭fork testing can be used to identify whether the deployed system is behaving as‬
‭expected.‬
‭6.‬ ‭Keep the team updated on new tooling and tool releases.‬‭Since Tact and FunC‬
‭are relatively new languages and not many tools are developed for them yet, it is‬
‭recommended for the team to be updated on the development of third-party tools‬
‭such as fuzzers, mutation testers, and static and dynamic analyzers, among others.‬
‭Additionally, keep track of new compiler releases, bug fixes, and their potential‬
‭effects on the project codebase.‬
‭Directory Structure‬
‭Creating a specific directory structure for the system’s tests will make it easier to develop‬
‭and maintain the test suite and find coverage gaps. This section contains brief guidelines‬
‭on defining a directory structure.‬
‭●‬ ‭Create individual directories for each test type (e.g.,‬‭unit/‬‭,‬‭integration/‬‭,‬‭fork/‬‭,‬
‭fuzz/‬‭) and for the utility contracts. The individual‬‭directories can be further divided‬
‭into directories based on components or behaviors being tested.‬
‭●‬ ‭Create a single base contract that inherits from the shared utility contracts and is‬
‭inherited by individual test contracts. This will help reduce code duplication across‬
‭the test suite.‬
‭●‬ ‭Create a clear naming convention for test files and test functions to make it easier to‬
‭filter tests and understand the properties or contracts that are being tested.‬
‭Unit Testing‬
‭The provided Blueprint test suite covers a limited number of scenarios and situations.‬
‭Some tests are failing, and there are sparse negative test cases. We provide the following‬
‭general recommendations based on our findings:‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭63‬

‭●‬ ‭Define a specification for each function‬‭and use it to guide the development of‬
‭the unit tests. Examples of function specifications can be found in the Function‬
‭Specification Example section above.‬
‭●‬ ‭Improve the unit tests’ coverage‬‭so that they test‬‭all functions and contracts in‬
‭the codebase. Use coverage reports and mutation testing to guide the creation of‬
‭additional unit tests.‬
‭●‬ ‭Use positive unit tests‬‭to test that functions and‬‭components behave as expected.‬
‭Ideally, each unit test should test a single property, with additional unit tests for‬
‭edge cases. The unit test should test that all expected side effects are correct.‬
‭●‬ ‭Improve the use of negative unit tests‬‭by not defining‬‭test cases that pass on any‬
‭failure within a test body; instead, each negative unit test should test for a specific‬
‭failure case.‬
‭●‬ ‭Ensure that no tests fail under normal conditions.‬‭Any failing tests should be an‬
‭alert that the code is not working as expected, and the team should fix the issue‬
‭immediately.‬
‭Integration and Fork Testing‬
‭Integration tests build on unit tests by testing how individual components integrate with‬
‭each other or with third-party contracts. It can often be useful to run integration testing on‬
‭a fork of the network to make the testing environment as close to production as possible‬
‭and to minimize the use of mock contracts whose implementation can differ from‬
‭third-party contracts. We provide the following general recommendations for performing‬
‭integration and fork testing:‬
‭●‬ ‭Use the interaction specification to develop integration tests.‬‭Ensure that the‬
‭integration tests aid in verifying‬‭the interactions‬‭specification.‬
‭●‬ ‭Identify valuable input data for the integration tests‬‭that can maximize code‬
‭coverage and test potential edge cases.‬
‭●‬ ‭Use negative integration tests‬‭, similar to negative‬‭unit tests, to test common‬
‭failure cases.‬
‭●‬ ‭Use fork testing to build on top of the integration testing suite.‬‭Fork testing will‬
‭aid in testing third-party contract integrations and the proper configuration of the‬
‭system once it is deployed.‬

‭Detailed Fix Review Results‬
‭TOB-PXL-1: The BulkInternalTransfer receiver computes the wrong total amounts‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #505‬‭. The‬‭BulkInternalTransfer‬‭receiver‬‭function of the‬
‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬‭contract now correctly updates‬‭the loop index variable.‬
‭TOB-PXL-2: Granting the role to the master funding contract on a funding wallet‬
‭contract will result in draining the funding wallet balance‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #559‬‭. The role condition check order‬‭has been reversed to fix the issue.‬
‭TOB-PXL-3: Users can inflate their funding wallet balance by sending an expired Swap‬
‭message to the settlement contract‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #589‬‭. The‬‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract‬‭has been updated to throw an‬
‭error if the‬‭extra_tokens‬‭has a‬‭TokenInfo‬‭with the‬‭token_is_input‬‭attribute set to‬
‭true.‬
‭TOB-PXL-4: SettlementVault balances are not updated in the PlaceOrder_Partial_2‬
‭receiver of the settlement contract‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #558‬‭. The‬‭PlaceOrder_Partial_2‬‭message‬‭receiver function of the‬
‭PixelswapSettlement‬‭contract now correctly updates‬‭the‬‭SettlementVault‬‭balances‬
‭to reflect the transfer of funds between funding and execution contracts‬
‭TOB-PXL-5: Lack of validation of PixelswapStreamPool configuration parameters‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #557‬‭and‬‭PR #677‬‭. The gas fee configuration‬‭values are not validated to be‬
‭within a limit.‬
‭TOB-PXL-6: Users can drain the TON balance of the PixelswapSettlement contract‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #556‬‭. Now the sum of the‬‭token_amt‬‭,‬‭forward_milliton‬‭, and‬
‭gas_transfer‬‭values is deducted from the user’s funding‬‭wallet while processing the‬
‭WithdrawFunds‬‭message.‬
‭TOB-PXL-7: Users can avoid paying the gas fee for the token creation transaction‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #555‬‭. The‬‭CreateToken‬‭message receiver‬‭has been updated to ensure that‬
‭the user and admin both provide enough TON for the required gas fee.‬
‭TOB-PXL-8: The tokens_count initial value in the PixelswapStreamPool contract is‬
‭zero‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #553‬‭. The‬‭init‬‭function now updates‬‭the‬‭tokens_count‬‭variable to track‬
‭the correct number of tokens added to the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract.‬
‭TOB-PXL-9: The returned TON amount from an order execution result is ignored‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #552‬‭. Now the‬‭SettlementVault‬‭balances‬‭are updated for the TON‬
‭amount value in the order execution result even when the‬‭msg.token_id‬‭is not null.‬

‭TOB-PXL-10: Wrong formula used for LP amount calculation‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #564‬‭. The updated code uses the correct‬‭formula for LP amount calculation.‬
‭TOB-PXL-11: Users can use nested PlaceOrders to drain the settlement contract‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #575‬‭. Now the‬‭spend_order_inputs‬‭function‬‭of the‬
‭PixelswapFundingWallet‬‭contract calls itself recursively‬‭to correctly update the user’s‬
‭funding wallet balance.‬
‭TOB-PXL-12: The LP tokens are never burned by the Stream Pool contract‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #560‬‭. The PixelSwap Labs Ltd. team‬‭updated the‬‭burn‬‭function of the‬
‭JettonFactory‬‭trait contract to send the‬‭burn‬‭message‬‭to the Jetton wallet owned by the‬
‭Stream Pool contract.‬
‭TOB-PXL-13: Lack of the pair_id and token_id validation in the PixelswapStreamPool‬
‭contract‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #605‬‭. The‬‭pair_id‬‭and‬‭token_id‬‭are‬‭now validated correctly against the‬
‭user-provided‬‭token_id‬‭.‬
‭TOB-PXL-14: The value attached to messages is not checked to be positive‬
‭Unresolved. The issue has not been resolved.‬
‭The client provided the following context for this finding’s fix status:‬
‭Acknowledged. Passing a negative value here will just cause a system error. This will also‬
‭never happen in the code logic.‬
‭TOB-PXL-15: The current balance is not checked before sending a message with a‬
‭non-zero value‬
‭Unresolved. The issue has not been resolved.‬
‭The client provided the following context for this finding’s fix status:‬
‭When exploring a fix we concluded that aborting with AFRs is not sufficient in many‬
‭cases. In many scenarios the transaction would already be completed when (and if)‬
‭balance would fall below zero, and in most cases it's either impossible or too‬
‭complicated to recover from this faulty state.‬
‭Instead we conducted an extensive review of the code logic to make sure a) no code path‬
‭sends out more TON than it should have, accounting for all credits and debits, b) prior to‬
‭sending TON the code always checks for the remaining balance of GAS_RESERVE (which is‬
‭configured to a different value per smart contract), and c) gas out + processing fee < gas‬
‭in.‬
‭In some specific scenarios, for example making a call to a contract after a long idle time,‬
‭c cannot be guaranteed due to the storage fee. We do not have a solution for this, and‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭68‬

‭this problem is also existing for native TON smart contracts such as Jetton contracts, so‬
‭we deem it good enough. To mitigate the risk we initially fund the contracts with enough‬
‭TON to cover storage fees for years.‬
‭TOB-PXL-16: The exec_id value is not validated for the internal orders in nested‬
‭PlaceOrder messages‬
‭Unresolved. The issue has not been resolved.‬
‭The client provided the following context for this finding’s fix status:‬
‭Acknowledged. Architecture of nested orders will be changed.‬
‭TOB-PXL-17: The token_balance get function reverts if a user balance is 0‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #562‬‭. The‬‭token_balance‬‭get function‬‭now returns 0 instead of reverting.‬
‭TOB-PXL-18: Different parsing formats for Jetton notification messages‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #565‬‭. The‬‭RemoveLiquidityJettonNotification‬‭message has been‬
‭updated to follow a common parsing format for the jetton notification message.‬
‭TOB-PXL-19: The JettonFactory contract allows minting zero tokens‬
‭Unresolved. The issue has not been resolved.‬
‭The client provided the following context for this finding’s fix status:‬
‭Acknowledged. Testing showed that negative transfer amounts will be rejected by the‬
‭system. This will also never happen in the code logic.‬
‭TOB-PXL-20: Incorrect gas calculations in several contracts‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #548‬‭. The codebase has been updated‬‭to correct gas calculations.‬
‭TOB-PXL-21: A privileged account can drain the PixelswapStreamPool contract‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #555‬‭. The‬‭CreateToken‬‭and‬‭CreateTradingPair‬‭message receiver‬
‭functions now send the creation fee only when they are called by a non privileged user.‬
‭TOB-PXL-22: The fee recipient accounts cannot be changed in the Stream Pool‬
‭contract‬
‭Unresolved. The issue has not been resolved.‬
‭The client provided the following context for this finding’s fix status:‬
‭Acknowledged. The protocol fee collector will be a peripheral smart contract that is‬
‭outside the scope of this audit.‬

‭TOB-PXL-23: The gas checks in the PixelswapStreamPool contract are wrongly placed‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #543‬‭. The gas checks in the‬‭PixelswapStreamPool‬‭contract have been‬
‭removed because they are already included in the entrypoint contracts.‬
‭TOB-PXL-24: Users can not deposit only Jetton to their funding wallet‬
‭Resolved in‬‭PR #548‬‭. The‬‭gas_for_incoming_jetton_transfer‬‭has been updated to be‬
‭equal to the the‬‭gas_check_jetton_notification‬‭parameter,‬‭which is 500 millitons.‬
