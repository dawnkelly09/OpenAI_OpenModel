 Test Coverage Disclaimer
 All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.
 Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be provided by a client, its aﬃliates, or its partners. As a result, the ﬁndings documented in this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, ﬂaws, or defects in the target system or codebase.
 Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

 Executive Summary
 Engagement Overview
 Drift Protocol engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of its decentralized exchange and smart contract. From November 7 to December 2, 2022, a team of two consultants conducted a security review of the client-provided source code, with six person-weeks of eﬀort. Details of the project’s timeline, test targets, and coverage are provided in subsequent sections of this report.
 From January 23 to January 25, 2023, Trail of Bits reviewed the ﬁxes and mitigations implemented by Drift Protocol to resolve the issues described in this report. A detailed review of the current status of each issue is provided in  Appendix E .
 Project Scope
 Our testing eﬀorts were focused on the identiﬁcation of ﬂaws that could result in a compromise of conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of the target system. We had access to the source code and documentation. We conducted this audit with full knowledge of the target system, including access to the source code and documentation. We performed static and dynamic testing of the target system and its codebase, using both automated and manual processes.
 Summary of Findings
 The audit did not uncover any high-severity ﬂaws that could impact system conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability. A summary of the ﬁndings and details on notable ﬁndings are provided below.

 Notable Findings
 Notable ﬂaws that could impact system conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability are listed below.
 ●  TOB-DRIFT-2
 The Anchor tests are not run as part of Drift Protocol’s CI process.
 ●  TOB-DRIFT-4
 A race condition in the Drift SDK causes client programs to operate on non-existent or possibly stale data. The race condition aﬀects many of the project’s Anchor tests, making them unreliable.
 Trail of Bits 6

 ●  TOB-DRIFT-12
 The exchange’s status is represented using an  enum  ,  which does not allow more than one individual operation to be paused. The exchange’s status is checked in multiple, inconsistent ways (e.g., in function annotations and in function bodies).
 ●  TOB-DRIFT-13
 Spot market access controls are only partially implemented.
 ●  TOB-DRIFT-16
 The codebase uses integer types inconsistently; data of similar kinds is represented using diﬀerently sized types, or types with diﬀerent signedness. There are nearly 700 casts from one integer type to another, each of which could cause its enclosing operation to fail.

 Project Goals
 The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Drift Protocol decentralized exchange and smart contract. We conducted the assessment through a combination of manual and automated review, including applying a comprehensive suite of tools to automatically uncover bugs, review of the architecture of the system for design
 ﬂaws, a detailed manual code review, and identiﬁcation and evaluation of security and correctness properties. We used the following non-exhaustive list of questions to drive our investigation throughout the assessment:
 ●  Can a malicious actor withdraw funds from the Drift Protocol contract in a manner other than intended?
 ●  Can funds become frozen?
 ●  Can math operations within the contract instructions result in overﬂow or underﬂow conditions?
 ●  Is it possible to bypass the checks on accounts used by instructions?
 ●  Can instructions use the wrong type of accounts?
 ●  Does Drift Protocol use oracles safely?

 Project Coverage
 This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:
 ●  Static analysis.  We ran Clippy over the codebase with  -W  pedantic and reviewed the warnings that were produced.
 ●  Test review.  We ran the Cargo tests and veriﬁed that  they passed. We attempted the same with the Anchor tests.
 ●  Manual review.  We manually reviewed the Drift Protocol  contract with a focus on answering the questions listed under  Project Goals .
 Coverage Limitations
 Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and indicates system elements that may warrant further review:
 ●  We reviewed the authentication of all the user, IF staker, and admin instructions.
 However, the admin instructions are only cursorily examined to ensure that the provided admin account has signed the transaction and that it is tied to the state account.
 ●  Much of the code is written in an inconsistent style. One would expect that if two functions fulﬁll similar roles, then they would exhibit similar structure. However, it is diﬃcult to discern such patterns from the current codebase (see  TOB-DRIFT-12  for an example). This fact considerably hindered manual review.
 ●  We were unable to reliably run the Anchor tests, we suspect because of
 TOB-DRIFT-4 . Thus, our ability to test the contract  dynamically was limited to using the Cargo tests.

 Codebase Maturity Evaluation
 A codebase maturity evaluation is a holistic assessment that seeks to identify systemic issues and/or opportunities for improvement in a client’s codebase and their overall approach to software development. While the  Detailed  Findings  section provides information about speciﬁc issues along with tactical steps to remediate them, the codebase maturity evaluation oﬀers strategic recommendations for widespread problems that will provide long-lasting value.
 Trail of Bits indicates the maturity of the codebase across various categories using a traﬃc-light protocol (akin to standards such as  TLP Version 2.0 ) that has been speciﬁcally tailored to provide a clear understanding of the areas in which the codebase is mature, underdeveloped, or somewhere in between. Deﬁciencies identiﬁed in the evaluation often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle (SDLC) that should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries, functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.
 Mature codebases align with industry best practices in software development and security; as a result, they tend to be better positioned to avoid security issues (e.g., they are less likely to introduce bugs) and to mitigate security issues that do arise (e.g., through robust controls and procedures that mitigate impact to the system and its users).
 For more information about the Codebase Maturity Evaluation categories and rating criteria, refer to  Appendix B .

 Trail of Bits 12

 Complexity
 Management
 Code is duplicated both literally and logically, suggesting that it does not employ the right abstractions
 ( TOB-DRIFT-15 ). Testing code is mixed with production code ( TOB-DRIFT-10 ). Some instructions require accounts that are unused ( TOB-DRIFT-18 ). The code does not employ common best practices, such as having build instructions ( TOB-DRIFT-1 ), reliable tests ( TOB-DRIFT-4 ),  a reliable CI process ( TOB-DRIFT-2 ), or a method for uncovering vulnerable dependencies ( TOB-DRIFT-3 ).
 Weak
 Cryptography and Key
 Management
 We found no issues related to cryptography or key management. Where signatures need to be performed, the platform appears to check them correctly.
 Satisfactory
 Decentralization
 The platform is administered by a central authority. Drift
 Protocol has indicated that they plan to develop a DAO.
 Further investigation is required to determine whether any aspect of the administrative APIs would be unsuitable for control by a DAO.
 Further
 Investigation
 Required
 Documentation
 The project has comprehensive  user documentation .  A
 “ Drift v2 Instructions ” document was shared with us.  We recommend incorporating it into the project’s documentation.
 Satisfactory
 Front-Running
 Resistance
 Some amount of front-running risk is inherent to a platform of this kind. We found no issues that would elevate that risk.
 Satisfactory
 Low-Level
 Manipulation
 The code uses several questionable low-level constructs that, even if they are not currently vulnerable, could lead to future problems. Examples include use of Anchor’s experimental zero-copy feature ( TOB-DRIFT-6 ), using oﬀsets into serialized data ( TOB-DRIFT-7 ), and expecting the in-memory size of data structures to be the same as their serialized size ( TOB-DRIFT-20 ).
 Moderate
 Trail of Bits 13

 Testing and
 Veriﬁcation
 Tests are not run as part of the project’s CI process
 ( TOB-DRIFT-2 ). The integration tests are unreliable as they depend on a library with race conditions
 ( TOB-DRIFT-4 ). Many tests use opaque constants, making it diﬃcult to tell whether the tests are checking for correct behavior ( TOB-DRIFT-17 ). The code would beneﬁt from more advanced testing methods, such as fuzzing and property-based testing. Drift Protocol does, however, have a  simulation framework  that was not considered  as part of this assessment.

 Detailed Findings 1. Lack of build instructions
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Testing
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-1
 Target:  README.md
 Description
 The Drift Protocol repository does not contain instructions to build, compile, test, or run the project. The project’s  README should include at  least the following information:
 ●  Instructions for building the project
 ●  Instructions for running the built artifacts
 ●  Instructions for running the project’s tests
 The closest thing we have found to build instructions appears in a script in the  drift-sim repository (ﬁgure 1.1). As shown in the ﬁgure below, building the project is non-trivial.
 Users should not be required to rediscover these steps on their own.
 git submodule update --init --recursive
 # build v2 cd  driftpy/protocol-v2 yarn && anchor build
 # build dependencies for v2 cd  deps/serum-dex/dex && anchor build &&  cd  ../../..
 # go back to top-level cd  ../../
 Figure 1.1:  drift-sim/setup.sh
 Additionally, the project relies on  serum-dex  , which  currently has an  open issue  regarding outdated build instructions. Thus, if a user visits the  serum-dex repository to learn how to build the dependency, they will be misled.
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice attempts to build and deploy her own copy of the Drift Protocol smart contract.
 Without instructions, Alice deploys it incorrectly. Users of Alice’s copy of the smart contract suﬀer ﬁnancial loss.
 Trail of Bits 17

 Recommendations
 Short term,  add the minimal information listed above to the project’s  README  . This will help users to build, run, and test the project .
 Long term,  as the project evolves, ensure that the  README is updated. This will help ensure that the  README does not communicate incorrect information  to users .

 2. Inadequate testing
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Testing
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-2
 Target:  .github/workflows/main.yml  ,  test-scripts/run-anchor-tests.sh
 Description
 The Anchor tests are not run as part of Drift Protocol’s CI process. Moreover, the script responsible for running the Anchor tests does not run all of them. Integrating all Anchor tests into the CI process and updating the script so it runs all tests will help ensure they are run regularly and consistently.
 Figure 2.1 shows a portion of the project’s  main GitHub  workﬂow, which runs the project’s unit tests. However, the ﬁle makes no reference to the project’s Anchor tests.
 -  name :  Run unit tests run :  cargo test --lib  # run unit tests
 Figure 2.1:  .github/workflows/main.yml#L52–L53
 Furthermore, the script used to run the Anchor tests runs only some of them. The relevant part of the script appears in ﬁgure 2.2. The  test_files array contains the names of nearly all of the ﬁles containing tests in the  tests directory.  However, the array lacks the following entries, and consequently does not run their tests:
 ●  ksolver.ts
 ●  tokenFaucet.ts test_files =( postOnlyAmmFulfillment.ts imbalancePerpPnl.ts
 ...  # 42 entries cancelAllOrders.ts
 )
 Figure 2.2:  test-scripts/run-anchor-tests.sh#L7–L53
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, unwittingly introduces a bug into the codebase. The test would be revealed by the Anchor tests. However, because the Anchor tests are not run in
 CI, the bug goes unnoticed.
 Trail of Bits 19

 Recommendations
 Short term:
 ●  Adjust the  main GitHub workﬂow so that it runs the  Anchor tests.
 ●  Adjust the  run-anchor-tests.sh script so that it runs  all Anchor tests (including those in  ksolver.ts and  tokenFaucet.ts  ).
 Taking these steps will help to ensure that all Anchor tests are run regularly and consistently.
 Long term, revise the  run-anchor-tests.sh script so  that the  test_files array is not needed. Move ﬁles that do not contain tests into a separate directory, so that only ﬁles containing tests remain. Then, run the tests in all ﬁles in the  tests directory. Adopting such an approach will ensure that newly added tests are automatically run.

 3. Invalid audit.toml prevents cargo audit from being run
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Auditing and Logging
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-3
 Target:  audit.toml
 Description
 The project’s  anchor.toml ﬁle contains an invalid  key. This makes running  cargo audit on the project impossible.
 The relevant part of the  audit.toml ﬁle appears in  ﬁgure 3.1. The  packages key is unrecognized by  cargo audit  . As a result,  cargo audit produces the error in ﬁgure 3.2 when run on the  protocol-v2 repository.
 [packages]
 source  =  "all"  # "all", "public" or "local"
 Figure 3.1:  .cargo/audit.toml#L27–L28 error: cargo-audit fatal error: parse error: unknown field `packages`, expected one of `advisories`, `database`, `output`, `target`, `yanked` at line 30 column 1
 Figure 3.2: Error produced by  cargo audit when run  on the  protocol-v2 repository
 Exploit Scenario
 A vulnerability is discovered in a  protocol-v2 dependency.  A RUSTSEC advisory is issued for the vulnerability, but because  cargo audit cannot  be run on the repository, the vulnerability goes unnoticed. Users suﬀer ﬁnancial loss.
 Recommendations
 Short term, either remove the  packages table from  the  anchor.toml ﬁle or replace it with a table recognized by  cargo audit  . In the project’s  current state,  cargo audit cannot be run on the project.
 Long term, regularly run  cargo audit in CI and verify  that it runs to completion without producing any errors or warnings. This will help the project receive the full beneﬁts of running  cargo audit by identifying dependencies with  RUSTSEC advisories.
 Trail of Bits 21

 4. Race condition in Drift SDK
 Severity:  Undetermined
 Diﬃculty:  Low
 Type: Undeﬁned Behavior
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-4
 Target:  sdk directory
 Description
 A race condition in the Drift SDK causes client programs to operate on non-existent or possibly stale data. The race condition aﬀects many of the project’s Anchor tests, making them unreliable. Use of the SDK in production could have ﬁnancial implications.
 When running the Anchor tests, the error in ﬁgure 4.1 appears frequently. The  data ﬁeld that the error refers to is read by the  getUserAccount function (ﬁgure 4.2). This function tries to read the  data ﬁeld from a  DataAndSlot object  obtained by calling getUserAccountAndSlot (ﬁgure 4.3). That  DataAndSlot object is set by the handleRpcResponse function (ﬁgure 4.4).
 TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')

 }

 ...

 Trail of Bits 22

 this .bufferAndSlot  =  { buffer:  newBuffer , slot:  newSlot ,
 }; const  account  =  this .decodeBuffer(newBuffer); this .dataAndSlot  =  { data:  account , slot:  newSlot ,
 }; this .onChange(account);
 }
 }
 Figure 4.4:  sdk/src/accounts/webSocketAccountSubscriber.ts#L55–L95
 If a developer calls  getUserAccount but  handleRpcResponse has not been called since the last time the account was updated, stale data will be returned. If  handleRpcResponse has  never  been called for the account in question,  an error like that shown in ﬁgure 4.1 arises.
 Note that a developer can avoid the race by calling
 WebSocketAccountSubscriber.fetch (ﬁgure 4.5). However,  the developer must manually identify locations where such calls are necessary. Errors like the one shown in
 ﬁgure 4.1 appear frequently when running the Anchor tests, which suggests that identifying such locations is nontrivial.
 async  fetch():  Promise < void >  { const  rpcResponse  = await  this .program.provider.connection.getAccountInfoAndContext( this .accountPublicKey,
 ( this .program.provider  as  AnchorProvider).opts.commitment
 ); this .handleRpcResponse(rpcResponse.context,  rpcResponse?.value);
 }
 Figure 4.5:  sdk/src/accounts/webSocketAccountSubscriber.ts#L46–L53
 We suspect this problem applies to not just user accounts, but any account fetched via a subscription  mechanism (e.g., state accounts or perp  market accounts).
 Note that despite the apparent race condition, Drift Protocol states that the tests run reliably for them.
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, unaware of the race condition, writes client code that uses the Drift SDK. Alice’s code unknowingly operates on stale data and proceeds with a transaction, believing it will result in ﬁnancial gain. However, when processed with actual on-chain data, the transaction results in ﬁnancial loss for Alice.
 Trail of Bits 23

 Recommendations
 Short term, rewrite all account getter functions so that they automatically call
 WebSocketAccountSubscriber.fetch  . This will eliminate  the need for developers to deal with the race manually.
 Long term, investigate whether using a subscription mechanism is actually needed.
 Another Solana RPC call could solve the same problem yet be more eﬃcient than a subscription combined with a manual fetch.

 5. Loose size coupling between function invocation and requirement
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Undeﬁned Behavior
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-5
 Target:  programs/drift/src/state/events.rs
 Description
 The implementation of the  emit_stack function relies  on the caller to use a suﬃciently large buﬀer space to hold a Base64-encoded representation of the discriminator along with the serialized event. Failure to provide suﬃcient space will result in an out-of-bounds attempt on either the write operation or the in the  base64::encode_config_slice call.
 emit_stack::<_,  424 >(order_action_record);
 Figure 5.1:  programs/drift/src/controller/orders.rs#L545 pub  fn  emit_stack <T:  AnchorSerialize  +  Discriminator,  const  N:  usize >(event:  T )  { let  mut  data_buf  =  [ 0 u8 ;  N]; let  mut  out_buf  =  [ 0 u8 ;  N]; emit_buffers(event,  & mut  data_buf[..],  & mut  out_buf[..])
 } pub  fn  emit_buffers <T:  AnchorSerialize  +  Discriminator>( event:  T , data_buf:  & mut  [ u8 ], out_buf:  & mut  [ u8 ],
 )  { let  mut  data_writer  =  std::io::Cursor::new(data_buf); data_writer
 .write_all(&<T  as  Discriminator>::discriminator())
 .unwrap(); borsh::to_writer(& mut  data_writer,  &event).unwrap(); let  data_len  =  data_writer.position()  as  usize ; let  out_len  =  base64::encode_config_slice(
 &data_writer.into_inner()[ 0 ..data_len], base64::STANDARD, out_buf,
 ); let  msg_bytes  =  &out_buf[ 0 ..out_len]; let  msg_str  =  unsafe  {  std:: str ::from_utf8_unchecked(msg_bytes)  }; msg!(msg_str);
 Trail of Bits 25

 }
 Figure 5.2:  programs/drift/src/state/events.rs#L482–L511
 Exploit Scenario
 A maintainer of the smart contract is unaware of this implicit size requirement and adds a call to  emit_stack using too small a buﬀer, or changes  are made to a type without a corresponding change to all places where  emit_stack uses that type. If the changed code is not covered by tests, the problem will manifest during contract operation, and could cause an instruction to panic, thereby reverting the transaction.
 Recommendations
 Short term, add a size constant to the type, and calculate the amount of  space required for holding the respective buﬀers. This ensures that changes to a type's size can be made throughout the code.
 Long term, create a trait to be used by the types with which  emit_stack is intended to work. This can be used to handle the size of the type, and also any other future requirement for types used by  emit_stack  .

 6. The zero-copy feature in Anchor is experimental
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Undeﬁned Behavior
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-6
 Target:  State structs
 Description
 Several structs for keeping state use Anchor’s zero-copy functionality. The  Anchor documentation  states that this is still an experimental  feature that should be used only when Borsh serialization cannot be used without hitting the stack or heap limits.
 Exploit Scenario
 The Anchor framework has a bug in the zero-copy feature, or updates it with a breaking change, in a way that aﬀects the security model of the Drift smart contract. An attacker discovers this problem and leverages it to steal funds from the contract.

 Figure 6.1: Example of a struct using zero copy
 Recommendations
 Short term, evaluate if it is possible to move away from using zero copy without hitting the stack or heap limits, and do so if possible. Not relying on experimental features reduces the risk of exposure to bugs in the Anchor framework.
 Long term, adopt a conservative stance by using stable versions of packages and features.
 This reduces both risk and time spent on maintaining compatibility with code still in ﬂux.

 7. Hard-coded indices into account data
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Undeﬁned Behavior
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-7
 Target:  perp_market_map.rs, spot_market_map.rs
 Description
 The implementations for both  PerpMarketMap and  SpotMarketMap use hard-coded indices into the accounts data in order to retrieve the  marked_index property without having to deserialize all the data.
 // market index 1160 bytes from front of account let  market_index  =  u16 ::from_le_bytes(*array_ref![data,  1160 ,  2 ]);
 Figure 7.1:  programs/drift/src/state/perp_market_map.rs#L110–L111 let  market_index  =  u16 ::from_le_bytes(*array_ref![data,  684 ,  2 ]);
 Figure 7.2:  programs/drift/src/state/spot_market_map.rs#L174
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, changes the layout of the structure or the width of the market_index property but fails to update one or more  of the hard-coded indices. Mallory notices this bug and ﬁnds a way to use it to steal funds.
 Recommendations
 Short term, add  consts that include the value of the  indices and the type size. Also add comments explaining the calculation of the values. This ensures that by updating the constants, all code relying on the operation will retrieve the correct part of the unlying data.
 Long term, add an implementation to the struct to unpack the  market_index from the serialized state. This reduces the maintenance burden of updating the code that accesses data in this way.

 Description
 The  handle_place_and_take_perp_order and handle_place_and_take_spot_order functions retrieve  two additional accounts that are passed to the instruction:  maker and  maker_stats  .  However, there is no check that the two accounts are linked (i.e., that their  authority is the same). Due to time constraints, we were unable to determine the impact of this ﬁnding.

 Exploit Scenario
 Mallory passes two unlinked accounts of the correct type in the places for  maker and maker_stats  , respectively. This causes the contract  to operate outside of its intended use.

 Short term, add a check that the  authority of the  accounts are the same.
 Long term, add all code for authentication of accounts to the front of instruction handlers.
 This increases the clarity of the checks and helps with auditing the authentication.

 9. Panics used for error handling
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Error Reporting
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-9
 Target: Various ﬁles in  programs/drift
 Description
 In several places, the code panics when an arithmetic overﬂow or underﬂow occurs. Panics should be reserved for programmer errors (e.g., assertion violations). Panicking on user errors dilutes the utility of the panic operation.
 An example appears in ﬁgure 9.1. The  adjust_amm function  uses both the question mark operator (  ?  ) and  unwrap to handle errors resulting  from “peg” related calculations. An overﬂow or underﬂow could result from an invalid input to the function. An error should be returned in such cases.
 budget_delta_peg  =  budget_i128
 .safe_add(adjustment_cost.abs())?
 .safe_mul(PEG_PRECISION_I128)?
 .safe_div(per_peg_cost)?; budget_delta_peg_magnitude  =  budget_delta_peg.unsigned_abs(); new_peg  =  if  budget_delta_peg  >  0  {
 ...
 }  else  if  market.amm.peg_multiplier  >  budget_delta_peg_magnitude  { market
 .amm
 .peg_multiplier
 .safe_sub(budget_delta_peg_magnitude)
 .unwrap()
 }  else  { 1
 };
 Figure 9.1:  programs/drift/src/math/repeg.rs#L349–L369
 Running Clippy with the following command identiﬁes 66 locations in the  drift package where  expect or  unwrap is used:
 cargo clippy -p drift -- -A clippy::all -W clippy::expect_used -W clippy::unwrap_used
 Many of those uses appear to be related to invalid input.
 Trail of Bits 32

 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, observes a panic in the Drift Protocol codebase. Alice ignores the panic, believing that it is caused by user error, but it is actually caused by a bug she introduced.
 Recommendations
 Short term, reserve the use of panics for programmer errors. Have relevant areas of the code return  Result::Err on user errors. Adopting such  a policy will help to distinguish the two types of errors when they occur.
 Long term, consider denying the following Clippy lints:
 ●  clippy::expect_used
 ●  clippy::unwrap_used
 ●  clippy::panic
 Although this will not prevent all panics, it will prevent many of them.

 10. Testing code used in production
 Severity:  Undetermined
 Diﬃculty:  Undetermined
 Type: Patching
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-10
 Target:  programs/drift/src/state/{oracle_map.rs,  perp_market.rs}
 Description
 In some locations in the Drift Protocol codebase, testing code is mixed with production code with no way to discern between them. Testing code should be clearly indicated as such and guarded by  #[cfg(test)] to avoid being called  in production.
 Examples appear in ﬁgures 10.1 and 10.2. The  OracleMap struct has a quote_asset_price_data ﬁeld that is used only when  get_price_data is passed a default  Pubkey  . Similarly, the AMM implementation  contains functions that are used only for testing and are not guarded by  #[cfg(test)]  .
 pub  struct  OracleMap <'a>  { oracles:  BTreeMap <Pubkey,  AccountInfoAndOracleSource<'a>>, price_data:  BTreeMap <Pubkey,  OraclePriceData>, pub  slot:  u64 , pub  oracle_guard_rails:  OracleGuardRails , pub  quote_asset_price_data:  OraclePriceData ,
 } impl <'a>  OracleMap<'a>  {
 ...
 pub  fn  get_price_data (& mut  self ,  pubkey:  & Pubkey )  ->
 DriftResult <&OraclePriceData>  { if  pubkey  ==  &Pubkey::default()  { return  Ok (& self .quote_asset_price_data);
 }

 // make sure tests dont have the default sqrt_k  = 0
 AMM  {
 Figure 10.2:  programs/drift/src/state/perp_market.rs#L490–L494
 Drift Protocol has indicated that the  quote_asset_price_data ﬁeld (ﬁgure 10.1)  is  used in production. This raises concerns because there is currently no way to set the contents of
 Trail of Bits 34

 this ﬁeld, and no asset’s price is perfectly constant (e.g., even stablecoins’ prices ﬂuctuate).
 For this reason, we have changed this ﬁnding’s severity from Informational to
 Undetermined.
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, introduces code that calls the  default_test function, not realizing it is intended only for testing. Alice introduces a bug as a result.
 Recommendations
 Short term, to the extent possible, avoid mixing testing and production code by, for example, using separate data types and storing the code in separate ﬁles. When testing and production code must be mixed, clearly mark the testing code as such, and guard it with  #[cfg(test)]  . These steps will help to ensure  that testing code is not deployed in production.
 Long term, as new code is added to the codebase, ensure that the aforementioned standards are maintained. Testing code is not typically held to the same standards as production code, so it is more likely to include bugs.

 11. Inconsistent use of checked arithmetic
 Severity:  Undetermined
 Diﬃculty:  Undetermined
 Type: Data Validation
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-11
 Target: Various ﬁles in  programs/drift
 Description
 In several locations, the Drift Protocol codebase uses unchecked arithmetic. For example, in  calculate_margin_requirement_and_total_collateral_and_liability_info
 (ﬁgure 11.1), the variable  num_perp_liabilities is  used as an operand in both a checked and an unchecked operation. To protect against overﬂows and underﬂows, unchecked arithmetic should be used sparingly.
 num_perp_liabilities  +=  1 ;
 } with_isolated_liability  &= margin_requirement  >  0  &&  market.contract_tier  ==  ContractTier::Isolated;
 } if  num_spot_liabilities  >  0  { validate!( margin_requirement  >  0 ,
 ErrorCode::InvalidMarginRatio,
 "num_spot_liabilities={} but margin_requirement=0" , num_spot_liabilities
 )?;
 } let  num_of_liabilities  =  num_perp_liabilities.safe_add(num_spot_liabilities) ?;
 Figure 11.1:  programs/drift/src/math/margin.rs#L499–L515
 Note that adding the following to the crate root will cause Clippy to fail the build whenever unchecked arithmetic is used:
 #![deny(clippy::integer_arithmetic)]
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, unwittingly introduces an arithmetic overﬂow bug into the codebase. The bug would have been revealed by the use of checked arithmetic. However, because unchecked arithmetic is used, the bug goes unnoticed.
 Trail of Bits 36

 Recommendations
 Short term, add the  #![deny(clippy::integer_arithmetic)] attribute to the  drift crate root. Add  #[allow(clippy::integer_arithmetic)] in rare situations where code is performance critical and its safety can be guaranteed through other means. Taking these steps will reduce the likelihood of overﬂow or underﬂow bugs residing in the codebase.
 Long term, if additional Solana programs are added to the codebase, ensure the
 #![deny(clippy::integer_arithmetic)] attribute is  also added to them. This will reduce the likelihood that newly introduced crates contain overﬂow or underﬂow bugs.

 12. Inconsistent and incomplete exchange status checks
 Severity:  Medium
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Access Controls
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-12
 Target:  programs/drift/src/instructions/{admin.rs  ,  keeper.rs  ,  user.rs}, programs/drift/src/state/state.rs
 Description
 Drift Protocol’s representation of the exchange’s status has several problems:
 ●  The exchange’s status is represented using an  enum  ,  which does not allow more than one individual operation to be paused (ﬁgures 12.1 and 12.2). As a result, an administrator could inadvertently unpause one operation by trying to pause another (ﬁgure 12.3).
 ●  The  ExchangeStatus variants do not map cleanly to  exchange operations. For example,  handle_transfer_deposit checks whether the  exchange status is
 WithdrawPaused (ﬁgure 12.4). The function’s name  suggests that the function checks whether “transfers” or “deposits” are paused.
 ●  The  ExchangeStatus is checked in multiple inconsistent  ways. For example, in handle_update_funding_rate (ﬁgure 12.5), both an  access_control attribute and the body of the function include a check for whether the exchange status is
 FundingPaused  .
 pub  enum  ExchangeStatus  {
 Active,
 FundingPaused,

 The  Medium post  describing the incident that occurred around May 11, 2022 suggests that the exchange’s pausing mechanisms contributed to the incident’s subsequent fallout:
 The protocol did not have a kill-switch where only withdrawals were halted. The protocol was paused in the second pause to prevent a further drain of user funds…
 This suggests that the pausing mechanisms should receive heightened attention to reduce the damage should another incident occur.
 Exploit Scenario
 Mallory tricks an administrator into pausing funding after withdrawals have already been paused. By pausing funding, the administrator unwittingly unpauses withdrawals.
 Recommendations
 Short term:
 ●  Represent the exchange’s status as a set of ﬂags. This will allow individual operations to be paused independently of one another.
 ●  Ensure exchange statuses map cleanly to the operations that can be paused. Add documentation where there is potential for confusion. This will help ensure developers check the proper exchange statuses.
 ●  Adopt a single approach for checking the exchange’s status and apply it consistently throughout the codebase. If an exception must be made for a check, explain why in a comment near that check. Adopting such a policy will reduce the likelihood that a missing check goes unnoticed.
 Long term, periodically review the exchange status checks. Since the exchange status checks represent a form of access control, they deserve heightened scrutiny. Moreover, the exchange’s pausing mechanisms played a role in past incidents.

 Recommendations
 Short term, add the missing access controls to the spot market functions in  admin.rs  . This will ensure that an administrator cannot accidentally perform an operation on an expired spot market.
 Long term, add tests to verify that each function involving spot markets fails when invoked on an expired spot market. This will increase conﬁdence that the access controls have been implemented correctly.

 14. Oracles can be invalid in at most one way
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Data Validation
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-14
 Target:  programs/drift/src/math/oracle.rs
 Description
 The Drift Protocol codebase represents oracle validity using an  enum  , which does not allow an oracle to be invalid in more than one way. Furthermore, the code that determines an oracle’s validity imposes an implicit hierarchy on the ways an oracle could be invalid. This design is fragile and likely to cause future problems.
 The  OracleValidity  enum is shown in ﬁgure 14.1, and  the code that determines an oracle’s validity is shown in ﬁgure 14.2. Note that if an oracle is, for example, both “too volatile” and “too uncertain,” the oracle will be labeled simply  TooVolatile  . A caller that does not account for this fact and simply checks whether an oracle is  TooUncertain could overlook oracles that are both “too volatile” and “too uncertain.” pub  enum  OracleValidity  {
 Invalid,
 TooVolatile,
 TooUncertain,

 OracleValidity variants. Alice writes code like  oracle_validity  !=
 OracleValidity::TooUncertain and unknowingly introduces  a bug into the codebase.
 Recommendations
 Short term, represent oracle validity as a set of ﬂags. This will allow oracles to be invalid in more than one way, which will result in more robust and maintainable code.
 Long term, thoroughly test all code that relies on oracle validity. This will help ensure the code’s correctness following the aforementioned change.

 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-15
 Target: Various ﬁles in  programs/drift
 Description
 Various ﬁles in the  programs/drift directory contain  duplicate code, which  can lead to incomplete ﬁxes or inconsistent behavior (e.g., because the code is modiﬁed in one location but not all).
 As an example, the code in ﬁgure 15.1 appears nearly verbatim in the functions liquidate_perp  ,  liquidate_spot  ,  liquidate_borrow_for_perp_pnl  ,  and liquidate_perp_pnl_for_deposit  .
 // check if user exited liquidation territory let  (intermediate_total_collateral,  intermediate_margin_requirement_with_buffer)  = if  !canceled_order_ids.is_empty()  ||  lp_shares  >  0  {

 In some places, the text itself is not obviously duplicated, but the logic it implements is clearly duplicated. An example appears in ﬁgures 15.2 and 15.3. Such “logical” code duplication suggests the code does not use the right abstractions.

 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, is asked to ﬁx a bug in  liquidate_perp  . Alice does not realize that the bug also applies to  liquidate_spot  , liquidate_borrow_for_perp_pnl  , and  liquidate_perp_pnl_for_deposit  ,  and
 ﬁxes the bug in only  liquidate_perp  . Eve discovers  that the bug is not ﬁxed in one of the other three functions and exploits it.
 Recommendations
 Short term:
 ●  Refactor  liquidate_perp  ,  liquidate_spot  , liquidate_borrow_for_perp_pnl  , and  liquidate_perp_pnl_for_deposit to eliminate the code duplication. This will reduce the likelihood of an incomplete ﬁx for a bug aﬀecting more than one of these functions.
 ●  Identify cases where the code uses the same logic, and implement abstractions to capture that logic. Ensure that code that relies on such logic uses the new abstractions. Consolidating similar pieces of code will make the overall codebase easier to reason about.
 Long term, adopt code practices that discourage code duplication. This will help to prevent this problem from recurring.

 Description
 The Drift Protocol codebase uses integer types inconsistently; data of similar kinds is represented using diﬀerently sized types or types with diﬀerent signedness. Conversions from one integer type to another present an opportunity for the contracts to fail and should be avoided.
 For example, the  pow method expects a  u32 argument.  However, in some places  u128 values must be cast to  u32 values, even though those  values are intended to be used as exponents (ﬁgures 16.1, 16.2, and 16.3).

 The following command reveals 689 locations where the  cast method appears to be used:
 grep -r -I '\.cast\>' programs/drift
 Each such use could lead to a denial of service if an attacker puts the contract into a state where the  cast always errors. Many of these uses could  be eliminated by more consistent use of integer types.
 Note that Drift Protocol has indicated that some of the observed inconsistencies are related to reducing rent costs.
 Exploit Scenario
 Mallory manages to put the contract into a state such that one of the nearly 700 uses of cast always returns an error. The contract becomes  unusable for Alice, who needs to execute a code path involving the vulnerable  cast  .
 Recommendations
 Short term, review all uses of  cast to see which might  be eliminated by changing the types of the operands. This will reduce the overall number of  cast  s and reduce the likelihood that one could lead to denial of service.
 Long term, as new code is introduced into the codebase, review the types used to hold similar kinds of data. This will reduce the likelihood that new  cast  s are needed.

 17. Use of opaque constants in tests
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Testing
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-17
 Target:  programs/drift/src/controller/liquidation/tests.rs
 Description
 Several of the Drift Protocol tests use constants with no explanation for how they were derived, which makes it diﬃcult to assess whether the tests are functioning correctly.
 Ten examples appear in ﬁgure 17.1. In each case, a variable or ﬁeld is compared against a constant consisting of 6–12 random-looking digits. Without an explanation for how these digits were obtained, it is diﬃcult to tell whether the constant expresses the correct value.

 Figure 17.1:  programs/drift/src/controller/liquidation/tests.rs#L1618–L1687
 Exploit Scenario
 Mallory discovers that a constant used in a Drift Protocol test was incorrectly derived and that the tests were actually verifying incorrect behavior. Mallory uses the bug to siphon funds from the Drift Protocol exchange.
 Recommendations
 Short term, where possible, compute values using an explicit formula rather than an opaque constant. If using an explicit formula is not possible, include a comment explaining how the constant was derived. This will help to ensure that correct behavior is being tested for. Moreover, the process of giving such explicit formulas could reveal errors.
 Trail of Bits 49

 Long term, write scripts to identify constants with high entropy, and run those scripts as part of your CI process. This will help to ensure the aforementioned standards are maintained.

 18. Accounts from contexts are not always used by the instruction
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Access Controls
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-18
 Target:  programs/drift/src/instructions/admin.rs
 Description
 The context deﬁnition for the  initialize instruction  deﬁnes a  drift_signer account.
 However, this account is not used by the instruction. It appears to be a remnant used to pass the address of the state PDA account; however, the need to do this was eliminated by the use of  find_program_address to calculate the address.  Also, in the initialize_insurance_fund_stake instruction, the  spot_market  ,  user_stats  , and state accounts from the context are not used by the  instruction.
 #[derive(Accounts)]
 pub  struct  Initialize <'info>  {
 #[account(mut)]
 pub  admin:  Signer <'info>,
 #[account( init, seeds = [b "drift_state" .as_ref()], space = std::mem::size_of::<State>() + 8, bump, payer = admin
 )]

 pub  drift_signer:  AccountInfo <'info>, pub  rent:  Sysvar <'info,  Rent>, pub  system_program:  Program <'info,  System>, pub  token_program:  Program <'info,  Token>,
 }
 Figure 18.1:  programs/drift/src/instructions/admin.rs#L1989–L2007
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, assumes that the  drift_signer account is used by the instruction, and she uses a diﬀerent address for the account, expecting this account to hold the contract state after the  initialize instruction  has been called.
 Trail of Bits 51

 Recommendations
 Short term, remove the unused account from the context. This eliminates the possibility of confusion around the use of the accounts.
 Long term, employ a process where a refactoring of an instruction’s code is followed by a review of the corresponding context deﬁnition. This ensures that the context is in sync with the instruction handlers.

 19. Unaligned references are allowed
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Undeﬁned Behavior
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-19
 Target:  programs/drift/src/lib.rs
 Description
 The Drift Protocol codebase uses the  #![allow(unaligned_references)] attribute.
 This allows the use of unaligned references throughout the program and could mask serious problems in future updates to the contract.
 #![allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
 #![allow(unaligned_references)]
 #![allow(clippy::bool_assert_comparison)]

 Figure 19.1:  programs/drift/src/lib.rs#L1–L4
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, accidentally introduces errors caused by the use of unaligned references, aﬀecting the contract operation and leading to a loss of funds.
 Recommendations
 Short term, remove the attributes. This ensures that the check for unaligned references correctly ﬂag such cases.
 Long term, be conservative with the use of attributes used to suppress warnings or errors throughout the codebase. If possible, apply them to only the minimum possible amount of code. This minimizes the risk of problems stemming from the suppressed checks.

 20. Size of created accounts derived from in-memory representation
 Severity:  Informational
 Diﬃculty:  High
 Type: Conﬁguration
 Finding ID: TOB-DRIFT-20
 Target: Files in  /programs/drift/src/state/
 Description
 When state accounts are initialized, the size of the account is set to std::mem::size_of::<ACCOUNT_TYPE>() + 8  , where the  eight extra bytes are used for the discriminator.  The structs for the state types all have a trailing ﬁeld with padding, seemingly to ensure the account size is aligned to eight bytes and to determine the size of the account. In other places, the code relies on the  size_of function to determine the type of accounts passed to the instruction.
 While we could not ﬁnd any security-related problem with the scheme today, this does mean that every account’s in-memory representation is inﬂated by the amount of padding, which could become a problem with respect to the limitation of the stack or heap size.
 Furthermore, if any of the accounts are updated in such a way that the  repr(C) layout size diﬀers from the  Anchor space reference , it could  cause a problem. For example, if the
 SpotMarket struct is changed so that its in-memory  representation is smaller than the required Anchor size, the  initialize_spot_market would  fail because the created account would be too small to hold the serialized representation of the data.
 #[account]
 #[derive(Default)]
 #[repr(C)]
 pub  struct  State  { pub  admin:  Pubkey , pub  whitelist_mint:  Pubkey , pub  discount_mint:  Pubkey , pub  signer:  Pubkey , pub  srm_vault:  Pubkey , pub  perp_fee_structure:  FeeStructure , pub  spot_fee_structure:  FeeStructure , pub  oracle_guard_rails:  OracleGuardRails , pub  number_of_authorities:  u64 , pub  number_of_sub_accounts:  u64 , pub  lp_cooldown_time:  u64 , pub  liquidation_margin_buffer_ratio:  u32 , pub  settlement_duration:  u16 , pub  number_of_markets:  u16 ,

 }

 }
 Figure 20.3: An example of the in-memory size used to determine the account type
 Exploit Scenario
 Alice, a Drift Protocol developer, unaware of the implicit requirements of the in-memory size, makes changes to a state account’s structure or adds a state structure account such that the in-memory size is smaller than the size needed for the serialized data. As a result, instructions in the contract that save data to the account will fail.
 Recommendations
 Short term, add an implementation to each state struct that returns the size to be used for the corresponding Solana account. This avoids the overhead of the padding and removes the dependency on assumption about the in-memory size.
 Long term, avoid using assumptions about in-memory representation of type within programs created in Rust. This ensures that changes to the representation do not aﬀect the program's operation.

 Summary of Recommendations
 Drift Protocol is a distributed exchange with multiple planned iterations. Trail of Bits recommends that Drift Protocol address the ﬁndings detailed in this report as they continue to secure their exchange.
 The following is a summary of this report’s main recommendations:
 ●  Ensure that the Anchor tests function reliably, and run them as part of the project’s
 CI process. Require the tests to pass before merging changes into the codebase.
 This will greatly reduce the possibility of bugs being introduced into the codebase.
 ( TOB-DRIFT-2 ,  TOB-DRIFT-4 )
 ●  Reduce the use of opaque constants in tests; prefer explicit formulae instead. This will increase conﬁdence that the tests are verifying correct behavior. ( TOB-DRIFT-17 )
 ●  Enforce consistency in how the exchange’s status is checked. This will make it easier to verify that the correct checks are performed for the correct operations.
 ( TOB-DRIFT-12 )
 ●  Implement access controls for the spot markets. Try to use the same patterns used for the perp markets’ access controls. The absence of access controls could allow the spot markets to be exploited. Using the same patterns used for the perp markets will make it easier to verify the spot market’s access controls’ correctness.
 ( TOB-DRIFT-13 )
 ●  Establish greater consistency among the uses of integer types. Try to use the same integer types for the similar kinds of data (e.g., amounts, prices, conversion rates, etc.). This will reduce the number cast operations required, and reduce the likelihood that any operation using them could fail. ( TOB-DRIFT-16 )
 ●  Look for opportunities to consolidate code. Identify and eliminate code that has been copied and pasted. When similar code resides in two diﬀerent functions, try to determine whether that code belongs in a third function. These steps will produce code that is easier to maintain and reason about. ( TOB-DRIFT-15 )
 We would like to emphasize the last bullet. As mentioned under  Coverage Limitations , much of the code is written in an inconsistent style, and it is diﬃcult to discern patterns from the codebase. We recommend that Drift Protocol consider what patterns they would like the code to exhibit (e.g., where/how various checks should be performed), and refactor the code so that it exhibits them.  Appendix D  contains  additional recommendations for improving the codebase’s readability.
 Trail of Bits 56

 Although we found no high-severity vulnerabilities, we recommend seeking a re-review of the code after it has been refactored/redesigned but before deployment, due to the nature and scope of the recommended changes.

 C. Non-Security-Related Findings
 The following recommendations are not associated with speciﬁc vulnerabilities. However, they enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the future.
 ●  Some statements are missing an ending semicolon. Use  cargo clippy -- -A clippy::all -W clippy::semicolon_if_nothing_returned to identify the lines.
 ●  The  liquidate_perp function contains a local variable  named  user_order_id  .
 However, when  instantiating  the Order struct, this  variable is not used for the user_order_id ﬁeld of the struct, but for the  order_id ﬁeld. Rename the variable order_id to better match its use.
 ●  In several places, variables with leading underscores are used. Per the following
 Clippy warning, “a leading underscore signals that a binding will not be used”:
 warning: used binding `_base_asset_amount` which is prefixed with an underscore. A leading underscore signals that a binding will not be used
 -->  programs/drift/src/controller/orders.rs:3050 :56
 | 3050 |         base_asset_amount = base_asset_amount.safe_add( _base_asset_amount )?;

 = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#used_underscore
 _binding
 ●  In several places,  the following is pattern  is used  to change the type of an error:
 match  loader.load()  {
 Ok (perp_market)  =>  Ok (perp_market),
 Err (e)  =>  { let  caller  =  Location::caller(); msg!( "{:?}" ,  e); msg!(
 "Could not load perp market {} at {}:{}" , market_index, caller.file(), caller.line()
 );
 Err (ErrorCode::UnableToLoadPerpMarketAccount)
 }
 }
 Trail of Bits 62

 Such code could be written more concisely using  map_err  , as follows:
 loader.load().map_err(|e| { let caller = Location::caller(); msg!("{:?}", e); msg!(
 "Could not load perp market {} at {}:{}", market_index, caller.file(), caller.line()
 );
 ErrorCode::UnableToLoadPerpMarketAccount
 })
 ●  In the following  error message , “greater or equal  to” should be “greater than”:
 validate!( revenue_amount  <=  depositors_amount,
 ErrorCode::SpotMarketVaultInvariantViolated,
 "revenue_amount={}  greater or equal to  the depositors_amount={}
 (depositors_claim={}, spot_market.deposit_balance={})" , revenue_amount, depositors_amount, depositors_claim, spot_market.deposit_balance
 )?;
 ●  Within the  Drift AMM documentation , the following  formulae could be simpliﬁed:
 bid_quote_reserve = quote_reserve - (quote_reserve / (100%/short_spread))
 ask_quote_reserve = quote_reserve + (quote_reserve / (100%/long_spread))
 Speciﬁcally, they could be rewritten as:
 bid_quote_reserve = quote_reserve * (1 - short_spread)
 ask_quote_reserve = quote_reserve * (1 + long_spread)
 ●  In several places, a fraction is represented as a pair of ﬁelds, one for a numerator and one for a denominator. For  example :
 pub  struct  FeeTier  { pub  fee_numerator:  u32 , pub  fee_denominator:  u32 , pub  maker_rebate_numerator:  u32 , pub  maker_rebate_denominator:  u32 , pub  referrer_reward_numerator:  u32 , pub  referrer_reward_denominator:  u32 , pub  referee_fee_numerator:  u32 , pub  referee_fee_denominator:  u32 ,
 }
 Trail of Bits 63

 The code would be clearer if each such pair of ﬁelds were replaced with a fraction data type.

 D. Code Quality Recommendations
 This appendix contains additional recommendations for improving the Drift Protocol codebase’s readability. The appendix speciﬁcally addresses  project layout ,  function comments ,  function complexity , and  general inconsistencies .  Functions involving a user’s liquidation status are addressed in some detail.
 Before performing any refactoring based on these recommendations, we strongly encourage taking the following steps:
 ●  Ensure that the project’s Anchor tests run reliably.
 ●  Incorporate the Anchor tests into the project’s CI process.
 ●  Require all tests to pass on a code change before merging the change into the codebase.
 Project Layout
 The project’s layout is unclear and undocumented. In particular, the purposes of the controller  ,  math  , and  verification subdirectories  are unclear. These subdirectories have several ﬁlenames in common. However, for a function X and ﬁle Y, it is unclear whether X should reside in  controller/  Y,  math/  Y, or  verification/  Y. The lack of a clear rationale for the layout makes navigating the project diﬃcult, as it can be hard to locate any given component or function.
 Within the  programs/drift folder, several ﬁles are  devoted to tests. Most of these are named  tests.rs  , but some are not, e.g.:
 ●  controller/pnl/delisting.rs
 ●  controller/orders/amm_jit_tests.rs
 In at least two cases, a test ﬁle contains a redundant module named  test  :
 ●  math/amm_spread/tests.rs
 ●  math/margin/tests.rs
 Function Comments
 It is a common Rust convention to precede a function with a comment describing the function’s purpose and how it works. However, the Drift Protocol codebase mostly does not follow this convention; the  drift crate contains approximately  778 functions, and only 34 of those are preceded by descriptive comments.
 Function Complexity
 The following quote is from the book “The Pragmatic Programmer”:
 Trail of Bits 65

 Design components that are self-contained, independent, and have a single, well-deﬁned purpose.
 We argue that the Drift Protocol codebase does not adhere to this principle.
 A function’s line count is one heuristic for its complexity. When run on the  drift crate,
 Clippy’s  too-many-lines lint produces 29 warnings.  Thus, there are at least 29 functions that should be considered for refactoring into smaller functions.
 Another heuristic for function complexity is long function names. While descriptive function names are good, a long name can indicate a function whose operation is overly complex, or whose integration into the larger system has not been well thought out.
 Several functions in the Drift Protocol codebase have exceedingly long names. The following table includes the ten longest lengths and the number of functions with a name of that length (with tests ﬁltered out):  1
 Function name length
 Number of functions 68 1 65 1 56 1 53 2 52 3 51 2 50 1 49 7 48 1 47 3
 Table D.1: The ten longest function name lengths and the number of functions with a name of that length
 The function with the longest name (68 characters) is the following:
 1  Following the removal of all test ﬁles:  find . -name  '*.rs' -exec sed -n 's/^.*fn
 \([a-z0-9_]\+\).*$/\1/;T;p' {} \; | while read X; do echo -n "$X" | wc -c; done | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -k2 -n -r | head -n 10
 Trail of Bits 66

 calculate_margin_requirement_and_total_collateral_and_liability_info
 The function is rather long (277 lines). Its name begs whether there should instead exist functions to compute the following:
 ●  Margin requirement
 ●  Total collateral
 ●  Total liability
 Note that addressing this issue is  not  merely about  renaming functions.
 Example: user liquidation status
 As examples of functions that are overly complex or whose integration into the larger system does not appear to have been well thought out, consider the three functions whose name includes  being_liquidated  :
 ●  User::is_being_liquidated
 ●  is_user_being_liquidated
 ●  validate_user_not_being_liquidated
 We address each of these functions individually.
 User::is_being_liquidated returns  true whenever the  user’s status is
 UserStatus::BeingLiquidated or  UserStatus::Bankrupt  .  The function’s name suggests that the function should check  only  for  UserStatus::BeingLiquidated  ,  and not  UserStatus::Bankrupt  . Also note that there is  a  User::is_bankrupt function, which (as its name suggests) checks  only  for  UserStatus::Bankrupt  .
 is_user_being_liquidated performs a calculation independent  of a user’s status. Note the similarity to the just-described function, which suggests that the two functions should perform similar operations, though they do not.
 validate_user_not_being_liquidated (ﬁgure D.1) ﬁrst  calls
 User::is_being_liquidated  . If the call returns  false  , validate_user_not_being_liquidated returns  Ok(())  .  Otherwise, the function calls is_user_being_liquidated  . If the latter call returns  true  , the function returns an error.
 If the latter call returns  false  , the function updates  the user’s status to
 UserStatus::Active and returns  Ok(())  .
 pub  fn  validate_user_not_being_liquidated ( user:  & mut  User, market_map:  & PerpMarketMap , spot_market_map:  & SpotMarketMap , oracle_map:  & mut  OracleMap, liquidation_margin_buffer_ratio:  u32 ,
 )  ->  DriftResult  {
 Trail of Bits 67

 if  !user.is_being_liquidated()  { return  Ok (());
 } let  is_still_being_liquidated  =  is_user_being_liquidated( user, market_map, spot_market_map, oracle_map, liquidation_margin_buffer_ratio,
 )?; if  is_still_being_liquidated  { return  Err (ErrorCode::UserIsBeingLiquidated);
 }  else  { user.status  =  UserStatus::Active;
 }
 Ok (())
 }
 Figure D.1:  programs/drift/src/math/liquidation.rs#L217–L243
 There are several problems with  validate_user_not_being_liquidated  :
 ●  The verb “validate” suggests that the function performs only validation. However, the function actually performs a state change. A verb like “update” or “refresh” would more accurately reﬂect what the function does.
 ●  The function has essentially no eﬀect when the user’s status is
 UserStatus::Active  . This has the potential for confusion.  A user that is active is not being liquidated. Thus, the function’s name suggests such a status should be
 “validated.” In fact, however, such a status is trusted as being accurate.
 ●  validate_user_not_being_liquidated inherits the problems  of
 User::is_being_liquidated by calling it. That is, validate_user_not_being_liquidated proceeds to call is_user_being_liquidated if the user’s status is
 UserStatus::BeingLiquidated or  UserStatus::Bankrupt  .
 To summarize, a developer must keep at least three pieces of information in mind when reviewing calls to  validate_user_not_being_liquidated  :
 ●  It performs a state change.
 ●  It short circuits (i.e., has essentially no eﬀect) when the user’s status is
 UserStatus::Active  .
 ●  It treats  UserStatus::BeingLiquidated and  UserStatus::Bankrupt the same, despite mentioning only “being liquidated” in the name.
 Trail of Bits 68

 Having to remember such facts creates undue cognitive load. Generally speaking, such cognitive load can be reduced by, e.g., ensuring each function performs a single, logically coherent task, and choosing function names that accurately reﬂect those tasks.
 Finally, none of the functions discussed in this section are documented. The fact that these functions are complex and could be misused increases the need for them to be documented.
 General Inconsistencies
 As mentioned under  Coverage Limitations , much of the  code is written in an inconsistent style. This issue is more about consistency than style. That is, changes in style from one part of the code to the next can be jarring, thereby making the code harder to read.
 To illustrate this point, consider the calls to  validate_user_not_being_liquidated
 (mentioned in the previous section). The function is called in seven places. In each place, the context is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. This can be seen, for example, in the variation in the calls’ line oﬀsets within their enclosing function bodies (table D.2).
 Call to  validate_user_not_being_liquidated
 Line oﬀset within enclosing function src/controller/orders.rs:100 6 src/controller/orders.rs:660 59 src/controller/orders.rs:2104 41 src/controller/orders.rs:2337 6 src/controller/orders.rs:2687 56 src/controller/orders.rs:3870 41 src/instructions/user.rs:1327 20
 Table D.2: The seven calls to  validate_user_not_being_liquidated and their line oﬀsets within their enclosing function bodies
 The diﬀerences in context make it diﬃcult to tell whether calls to validate_user_not_being_liquidated are missing, and  whether
 Trail of Bits 69

 validate_user_not_being_liquidated is being used correctly. If, for example, validate_user_not_being_liquidated was always the  ﬁrst function called in an enclosing function, it would be easier to tell whether such a call was missing.
 To add to the above:
 ●  Three of the seven calls are  preceded  by a check of  user.is_bankrupt()  . Four of the seven calls are  followed  by a check of  user.is_bankrupt()  .
 Recall from the previous section that  validate_user_not_being_liquidated treats
 UserStatus::Bankrupt specially. Moreover,  validate_user_not_being_liquidated performs a state change. Thus, deciding whether the seven calls to validate_user_not_being_liquidated could be moved  before or after the call to user.is_bankrupt() is non-trivial.
 Finally, for reasons that are unclear:
 ●  Five of the seven calls return an error on failure. Two of the seven calls return  Ok(0)
 on failure.
 To summarize, the irregular way that  validate_user_not_being_liquidated is now called makes it diﬃcult to tell whether  validate_user_not_being_liquidated is being used correctly, and whether it is used in all places where needed. Moreover, the fact that validate_user_not_being_liquidated performs non-obvious  state changes makes imposing consistency on its uses more diﬃcult.
 Style Guides
 The following style guides provide recommendations beyond those of this appendix:
 ●  The Pragmatic Programmer  documents “processes that  are virtually universal, and ideas that are almost axiomatic” on design, project management, and coding.
 ●  Rust API Guidelines  is “a set of recommendations on  how to design and present APIs for the Rust programming language.”
 ●  The Rust Reference  contains many examples of idiomatic  Rust code.
 ●  Many of  Clippy ’s pedantic lints ﬂag code that could  be written in a simpler or more idiomatic way.

 Detailed Fix Review Results
 TOB-DRIFT-1: No build instructions
 Resolved in  5209b9bc17e81fe3c11e9817d98833d0eaf94fd1  .  The project’s  README now includes instructions for building it, and for running its Rust and Anchor tests. We veriﬁed that the provided commands work as described.
 TOB-DRIFT-2: Inadequate testing
 Resolved in  af85e4c518dfeb70d80e30fb8544f53c116c973c (which also resolves
 TOB-DRIFT-4 below). The Anchor tests are now run as part of CI. We reviewed recent
 GitHub logs to verify that the tests are capable of passing in CI.
 For reasons we did not investigate, some test ﬁles were removed (  adminWidthdraw.ts  , ksolver,ts  , and  tokenFaucet.ts  ).
 Also,  the  run-anchor-tests.sh script still uses the  test_files array (ﬁgure E.1). We continue to recommend that the script be revised so that the array is not needed.

 TOB-DRIFT-3: Invalid audit.toml prevents cargo audit from being run
 Resolved in  0df896decaf21649fd772c709837d8c1b8d44452  .  The oﬀending audit.toml entry was removed, and  cargo audit now  completes without error when run on the project.
 TOB-DRIFT-4: Race condition in Drift SDK
 Resolved in  af85e4c518dfeb70d80e30fb8544f53c116c973c (which also resolves
 TOB-DRIFT-2 above).  forceGetUserAccount functions  were added to  user.ts and driftClient.ts  . These new functions call  WebSocketAccountSubscriber.fetch before accessing  UserAccount data. Calls to  WebSocketAccountSubscriber.fetch were added in other places as well. The Anchor tests now pass, suggesting such calls were inserted where needed.
 TOB-DRIFT-5: Loose size coupling between function invocation and requirement
 Resolved in  5f25f2a2d5548d9e82933e3d907fd01354e04a7a (which also resolves
 TOB-DRIFT-20 below). A  Size trait was added that allows  a type to specify its storage size in a  SIZE constant. Tests are used to verify that the  values of types’  SIZE constants match the sizes of the types’ in-memory representations. The use of  emit_stack was updated to use
 OrderActionRecord::SIZE instead of a hard-coded constant.

 TOB-DRIFT-6: The zero-copy feature in Anchor is experimental
 Unresolved. Drift Protocol has not resolved this issue.
 TOB-DRIFT-7: Hardcoded indices into account data
 Resolved in  8e4f15771cce51f6c74628c19b74c5e83c51ed69  .  A  MarketIndexOffset trait was added that allows a type to specify its market index oﬀset in a
 MARKET_INDEX_OFFSET constant. The trait is implemented  for the  PerpMarket and
 SpotMarket types. Tests are used to help verify that  the named constants are set correctly
 (see ﬁgure E.2).
 #[test]
 fn  spot_market ()  { let  mut  spot_market  =  SpotMarket  { market_index:  11 ,
 ..SpotMarket::default()
 }; create_anchor_account_info!(spot_market,  SpotMarket,  spot_market_account_info); let  data  =  spot_market_account_info.try_borrow_data().unwrap(); let  market_index  = u16 ::from_le_bytes(*array_ref![data,  SpotMarket::MARKET_INDEX_OFFSET,  2 ]); assert_eq! (market_index,  spot_market.market_index);
 }
 Figure E.2:  programs/drift/src/state/traits/tests.rs#L76-L88
 While we consider the issue resolved, the tests could be further improved to help increase conﬁdence in the constants’ values. Speciﬁcally, assertions could be added to verify that the market index changes during the test. For example, the following line could be added as the ﬁrst line of the  spot_market test:
 assert_ne!(SpotMarket::default().market_index, 11);
 TOB-DRIFT-8: Missing veriﬁcation of maker and maker_stats accounts
 Resolved in  40f0054799f786e113ec489e03167da8c929ad59  .  In both locations named in the ﬁnding, the code now checks that the  maker and  maker_stats accounts have the same authority.
 TOB-DRIFT-9: Panics used for error handling
 Resolved in  f63b160024afb4001973a6a3ba80d2db149434e8  .  A  SafeUnwrap trait was added to, e.g., convert  Option  s into  Result  s. Calls  to  safe_unwrap are not used where panics were used before. We veriﬁed that Clippy’s  expect_used  ,  unwrap_used  , and panic lints produce no warnings when applied to the  drift crate.
 While we consider the issue resolved, we recommend against implementing  SafeUnwrap for  Result (ﬁgure E.3). If  safe_unwrap were accidentally  called on a  Result where no call
 Trail of Bits 74

 was needed, the call would eﬀectively hide the original error by turning it into
 ErrorCode::FailedUnwrap  .
 impl <T,  U>  SafeUnwrap  for  Result <T,  U>  { type  Item  =  T;
 #[track_caller]
 #[inline(always)]
 fn  safe_unwrap ( self )  ->  DriftResult <T>  { match  self  {
 Ok (v)  =>  Ok (v),
 Err (_)  =>  { let  caller  =  Location::caller(); msg!( "Unwrap error thrown at {}:{}" ,  caller.file(),  caller.line());
 Err (ErrorCode::FailedUnwrap)
 }
 }
 }
 }
 Figure E.3:  programs/drift/src/math/safe_unwrap.rs#L28-L43
 Instead, we recommend using  Result::map_err wherever  such a conversion is necessary. Thus,  safe_unwrap would be used only for  Option  s, and  map_err would be used for  Result  s. Adopting this strategy would make  it impossible to accidentally call safe_unwrap on a  Result where no call was needed.
 Also, we noticed that a Git hook was added to run Clippy before each commit (ﬁgure E.4).
 However, the commands in the hook fail when run. In particular, running Clippy with  -D warnings fails. This suggests that either the hook  is not being set correctly, or the failure is not being caught.
 cargo +stable clippy -p drift --  -D warnings  -D clippy::unwrap_used  -D clippy::expect_used -D clippy::panic

 TOB-DRIFT-10: Testing code used in production
 Partially resolved in  39f7292a2084cd0d275d5671dc58aa2e648787d8  .  The implementation of the  default_test function in  ﬁgure  10.2  is now guarded by
 #[cfg(test)]  . Other functions are now guarded by  #[cfg(test)] as well.
 However, as noted in TOB-DRIFT-10, the  quote_asset_price_data ﬁeld ( ﬁgure 10.1 ) is used in production, contrary to our initial understanding. This raises concerns because there is currently no way to set the contents of this ﬁeld, and no asset’s price is perfectly constant. Commit  39f7292a2084cd0d275d5671dc58aa2e648787d8 does not introduce a way to set the ﬁeld. Hence, we consider this issue only partially resolved.

 TOB-DRIFT-11: Inconsistent use of checked arithmetic
 Unresolved. Drift Protocol has not resolved this issue.
 TOB-DRIFT-12: Inconsistent and incomplete exchange status checks
 Resolved in  7f7a04d5dc87962f3fa511139c06e699d312c738  .  The exchange’s status is now represented using a  u8  . Individual bits are set  using an  enum generated by the enumflags2 crate. Furthermore, some consistency was  imposed between statuses and pausable operations. For example,  handle_transfer_deposit now checks whether the
 DepositPaused ﬂag is set.
 The ﬂags are still checked in multiple ways. For example, handle_resolve_perp_bankruptcy (ﬁgure E.5) and handle_update_spot_market_cumulative_interest (ﬁgure  E.6). However, in the former case, the check within the body appears redundant, and thus could be removed. In the latter case, it appears the check could not be moved into an  access_control annotation, because an action is performed even when the exchange is paused.

 Some (oracle_price_data), now,
 )?;
 }
 Ok (())
 }
 Figure E.6:  programs/drift/src/instructions/keeper.rs#L1150-L1188
 Note that the original ﬁnding was about the exchange’s status, and we therefore consider it resolved. However, we recommend incorporating  enumflags2 into the representation of the markets’ statuses as well (see ﬁgure E.7).
 pub  enum  MarketStatus  {
 Initialized,
 // warm up period for initialization,  fills are paused
 Active,
 // all operations allowed
 FundingPaused,  // perp: pause funding rate updates  | spot: pause interest updates
 AmmPaused,
 // amm fills are prevented/blocked
 FillPaused,
 // fills are blocked
 WithdrawPaused,  // perp: pause settling positive  pnl | spot: pause withdrawing asset
 ReduceOnly,
 // fills only able to reduce liability
 Settlement,  // market has determined settlement  price and positions are expired must be settled
 Delisted,
 // market has no remaining participants
 }

 TOB-DRIFT-13: Spot market access controls are incomplete
 Partially resolved in  cb0cb29049fe9feae18cf62bfdf060e53bcc3422  .  access_control annotations were added to most functions involving spot markets. Functions involving perpetual and spot markets now largely coincide in terms of the exchange statuses they
 Trail of Bits 77

 check. However, there still appear to be some discrepancies. In particular, the example from  ﬁgures 13.3 and 13.4  (repeated in ﬁgures E.8  and E.9) still applies to the updated code.
 #[access_control( exchange_not_paused(&ctx.accounts.state)

 Result <()>  {

 TOB-DRIFT-19: Unaligned references are allowed
 Resolved in  8d0b518b765879cb6fbff8eced30bdaa397006ce  .  The
 #![allow(unaligned_references)] crate level attribute  was removed.
 TOB-DRIFT-20: Size of created accounts derived from in-memory representation
 Resolved in  5f25f2a2d5548d9e82933e3d907fd01354e04a7a (which also resolves
 TOB-DRIFT-5 above). A  Size trait was added that allows  a type to specify its storage size in a  SIZE constant. Tests are used to verify that the  values of types’  SIZE constants match the sizes of the types’ in-memory representations. These  SIZE constants are now used where expressions involving  std::mem::size_of were used  before.
