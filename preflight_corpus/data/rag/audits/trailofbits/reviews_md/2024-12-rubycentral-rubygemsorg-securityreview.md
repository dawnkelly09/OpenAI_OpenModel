‭Executive Summary‬
‭Engagement Overview‬
‭Ruby Central engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of RubyGems.org. RubyGems is a‬
‭gem hosting service for the Ruby community. It provides a web interface, an API, storage‬
‭needs, and other functionality necessary to operate as the de facto Ruby package‬
‭management solution.‬
‭A team of three consultants conducted the review from August 19 to September 6, 2024,‬
‭for a total of five engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on common web‬
‭application security vulnerabilities, authentication and authorization controls,‬
‭infrastructure security concerns, and a comparative analysis of other package management‬
‭solutions. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and‬
‭dynamic testing of the RubyGems.org repository, associated infrastructure, and web‬
‭application using automated and manual processes.‬
‭Observations and Impact‬
‭The RubyGems application is a three-tier web application consisting of a front end, back‬
‭end, and database layers. Both the application and its associated infrastructure use‬
‭industry-standard libraries, frameworks, and tooling. This made our review straightforward‬
‭and demonstrates that the development process is building on a solid foundation.‬
‭We identified one high-severity finding related to optional StartTLS encryption in the SMTP‬
‭mailer (‬‭TOB-RGM-5‬‭) and a noteworthy medium-severity‬‭finding related to missing‬
‭multi-party approval for production deployments (‬‭TOB-RGM-31‬‭).‬‭These findings are‬
‭unrelated and are not indicative of systemic, high-severity vulnerabilities in RubyGems’‬
‭functionality.‬
‭Although generally of lesser severity, the other code review findings cluster around two‬
‭categories: configuration (‬‭TOB-RGM-1‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-2‬‭, and‬‭TOB-RGM-6‬‭) and data validation‬
‭(‬‭TOB-RGM-3‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-8‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-9‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-11‬‭, and‬‭TOB-RGM-13‬‭). We recommend‬
‭further testing, whether internal or external, to audit for these specific classes of‬
‭vulnerabilities.‬
‭Regarding infrastructure, most issues result from manual management of cloud resources‬
‭(‬‭TOB-RGM-16‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-20‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-29‬‭). The Ruby Central‬‭team usually maintains the‬
‭infrastructure via Terraform, and should work toward limiting manual, ad-hoc‬
‭manipulations. Moreover, projects should have better separation (‬‭TOB-RGM-21‬‭).‬
‭We found an issue related to the development of Terraform files that may represent a‬
‭single point of failure: the lack of a dual approval requirement for GitHub pull requests‬
‭enables compromise of a single GitHub account, which can be escalated to achieve‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭6‬

‭complete RubyGems compromise (‬‭TOB-RGM-31‬‭). This issue, while of medium severity, is a‬
‭challenge to remediate due to the small size of the Ruby Central team.‬
‭We observed that some AWS API access keys are not refreshed for a long time‬
‭(‬‭TOB-RGM-32‬‭). This observation implies the need for‬‭regular inventorization of credentials,‬
‭and rotation of old ones.‬
‭The results of our competitive analysis and corresponding recommendations are given in‬
‭appendix D‬‭.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security‬
‭review, Trail of Bits recommends that Ruby Central take the following steps:‬
‭●‬ ‭Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.‬‭These‬‭findings should be‬
‭addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur‬
‭when addressing other recommendations.‬
‭●‬ ‭Make tickets for recommendations given in‬‭competitive‬‭analysis appendix D‬‭.‬
‭We recommend addressing the high-priority findings in the near future.‬
‭Lower-priority findings can be addressed over the longer term, but should not be‬
‭forgotten before implementation or dismissed without discussion inside the‬
‭RubyGems team.‬
‭●‬ ‭Consider investing in custom static analysis rules and expertise.‬‭Static analysis‬
‭is a useful methodology for finding variants of bugs and ensuring that you do not‬
‭make the same mistake twice. Simple “disable security” flags, such as those found in‬
‭TOB-RGM-2‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-4‬‭, and‬‭TOB-RGM-5‬‭, are ideal candidates‬‭for static analysis‬
‭rules. For this reason, we recommend developing custom static analysis rules and‬
‭expertise using a tool like Semgrep or CodeQL to help find these types of bugs.‬
‭●‬ ‭Consider deprecating and removing any reliance on Marshal data.‬‭Both‬
‭TOB-RGM-3‬‭and‬‭TOB-RGM-9‬‭relate to Marshal data. Although‬‭these findings are‬
‭informational, they pose a long-term risk that could lead to higher-severity‬
‭vulnerabilities like remote code execution in the future. The risks of using Marshal‬
‭are well-known within the Ruby community, and this data format can generally be‬
‭replaced with safer alternatives such as JSON.‬
‭●‬ ‭Reduce the number of AWS users and roles with write access to production‬
‭resources.‬‭Ideally, only the CI/CD pipeline and a‬‭break-glass user should have such‬
‭access (see‬‭TOB-RGM-16‬‭). Access to some services should‬‭be limited even for the‬
‭pipeline (‬‭TOB-RGM-23‬‭). Additionally, we recommend‬‭isolating projects into different‬
‭AWS accounts (‬‭TOB-RGM-21‬‭) and cleaning up unused resources.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬

‭●‬ ‭Enable and configure Amazon’s services for logging, monitoring and alerting‬‭:‬
‭Security Hub‬‭,‬‭CodeGuru‬‭,‬‭GuardDuty‬‭,‬‭VPC Flow Logs‬‭,‬‭CloudTrail‬‭. The first three‬
‭services will help keep AWS secure over time, and the last two will facilitate incident‬
‭response. These services should have‬‭monitoring and‬‭alerting‬‭enabled.‬
‭●‬ ‭Review and improve personal security of users with administrative access to‬
‭AWS, GitHub, and other services.‬‭This includes, for‬‭example: enabling and/or‬
‭enforcing strong (phishing-resistant) two-factor authentication (2FA); securing‬
‭development machines (e.g., timely software updates, full-disk encryption, and‬
‭separate machines for development); using hardware keys for management of SSH‬
‭keys; and periodically reviewing existing API keys.‬
‭●‬ ‭Consult the following documents for additional AWS security‬
‭recommendations.‬‭While this audit covered the most‬‭important security gaps,‬
‭many minor or more complex guidelines could also be implemented. These include‬
‭Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog v1.0‬‭,‬‭Best‬‭practices for using the Terraform‬
‭AWS Provider‬‭, and‬‭aSecureCloud library‬‭.‬
‭●‬ ‭Review the security of Kubernetes deployments.‬‭Both‬‭RubyGems and Shipit‬
‭configurations should be audited, as they live in the same cluster. The open-source‬
‭Shipit application itself should be audited, as it may have not been yet (except‬
‭potentially as part Shopify’s bug bounty program).‬

‭Project Goals‬
‭The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of RubyGems.org.‬
‭Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:‬
‭●‬ ‭Is RubyGems susceptible to common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting‬
‭(XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), SQL injection (SQLi), and server-side request‬
‭forgery (SSRF)?‬
‭●‬ ‭Does RubyGems properly configure web application defenses such as the‬
‭Content-Security-Policy‬‭and‬‭Strict-Transport-Security‬‭HTTP headers,‬
‭and the‬‭SameSite‬‭and‬‭HTTPOnly‬‭cookie parameters?‬
‭●‬ ‭Can an attacker bypass authentication in the‬‭RubyGems‬‭web interface?‬
‭●‬ ‭Can unauthenticated users perform unauthorized operations in the‬‭RubyGems‬‭web‬
‭interface?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are access controls properly enforced?‬
‭●‬ ‭Is 2FA implemented securely?‬
‭●‬ ‭Is proper isolation achieved in the RubyGems infrastructure?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are internal and privileged APIs hardened against external and unauthorized‬
‭access?‬
‭●‬ ‭Does RubyGems deserialize untrusted data securely?‬
‭●‬ ‭Is RubyGems resilient against common denial-of-service vectors?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are secrets managed and stored securely?‬
‭●‬ ‭Are AWS services securely configured?‬

‭Project Coverage‬
‭This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by‬
‭our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:‬
‭●‬ ‭A manual review of cryptographic functionality within the application‬
‭●‬ ‭A manual review of GitHub Actions CI/CD jobs‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of the RubyGems web interface, with a focus on:‬
‭○‬ ‭Common web application security concerns like XSS, SQLi, CSRF, and SSRF‬
‭○‬ ‭Common HTTP security defenses such as‬‭Content-Security-Policy‬‭and‬
‭Strict-Transport-Security‬
‭○‬ ‭Dynamic testing for authorization issues‬
‭●‬ ‭Static analysis using Semgrep‬
‭●‬ ‭Secrets scanning using Semgrep‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of Kubernetes manifests‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of Rails configuration files‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of controllers and Pundit policies for authorization issues‬
‭●‬ ‭A review for deserialization, remote code execution, and mass assignment bugs‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of the Trusted Publishing implementation‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of authentication implementation‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of Terraform files and deployed AWS resources in the following services:‬
‭IAM, EKS, ECR, S3, EC2, RDS, VPC‬
‭●‬ ‭A review of the Fastly configuration‬
‭Coverage Limitations‬
‭Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage‬
‭limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and‬
‭indicates system elements that may warrant further review:‬
‭●‬ ‭We did not audit the configuration of the Shipit deployment application due to time‬
‭constraints. We also did not audit the security of the configuration of the‬‭quay.io‬
‭organization, which stores Shipit Docker images.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭12‬

‭●‬ ‭While our review of the EKS configurations found nothing inherently insecure, the‬
‭time spent on the review of the actual Kubernetes configurations was minimal. We‬
‭recommend focusing any subsequent security audits on the system’s Kubernetes‬
‭and Shipit components.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭13‬

‭Automated Testing‬
‭Trail of Bits uses automated techniques to extensively test the security properties of‬
‭software. We use both open-source static analysis and fuzzing utilities, along with tools‬
‭developed in house, to perform automated testing of source code and compiled software.‬
‭Test Harness Configuration‬
‭We used the following tools in the automated testing phase of this project:‬

‭Codebase Maturity Evaluation‬
‭Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of‬
‭the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies‬
‭identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that‬
‭should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,‬
‭functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.‬

‭Required‬
‭Authentication /‬
‭Access Controls‬
‭We spent a significant portion of this audit reviewing‬
‭authentication procedures and access controls. This‬
‭included basic web application login functionality,‬
‭administrative functionality, and infrastructure access‬
‭controls. We found a single, informational‬
‭application-related issue (‬‭TOB-RGM-7‬‭). Additionally,‬‭we‬
‭found many infrastructure issues related to‬
‭authentication and access controls (‬‭TOB-RGM-16‬‭,‬
‭TOB-RGM-17‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-18‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-20‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-21‬‭,‬
‭TOB-RGM-22‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-23‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-24‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-27‬‭,‬
‭TOB-RGM-31‬‭, and‬‭TOB-RGM-33‬‭).‬
‭Weak‬
‭Complexity‬
‭Management‬
‭The system manages complexity well. It is built on‬
‭industry-standard technologies such as Rails, Terraform,‬
‭and Kubernetes. This encourages the system to follow‬
‭best practices and provides a well-trodden path for most‬
‭functionality. However, as with most systems that have‬
‭existed for many years, there is a moderate amount of‬
‭legacy code and functionality. The volume of security and‬
‭code quality findings indicate there is room for‬
‭improvement. However, the severity of these findings is‬
‭generally low, which indicates that the RubyGems team‬
‭has maintained a security mindset throughout the‬
‭lifetime of the application.‬
‭Satisfactory‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭15‬

‭Configuration‬
‭Configuration management is inline with industry‬
‭standards and mainstream tooling. The system’s‬
‭configuration is generally well-delineated between files,‬
‭environment variables, command-line arguments, and‬
‭information gathered at runtime, such as secrets.‬
‭Although we found a number of configuration-related‬
‭issues, they were generally of lower severity.‬
‭Satisfactory‬
‭Cryptography‬
‭and Key‬
‭Management‬
‭Key and secret management is generally well-designed‬
‭within the application and associated infrastructure.‬
‭There were a moderate number of cryptographic‬
‭findings, including one high-severity finding regarding‬
‭SMTP encryption in transit (‬‭TOB-RGM-5‬‭).‬
‭The application avoids building its own cryptographic‬
‭primitives and instead relies on mainstream‬
‭implementations. This is a good practice and should be‬
‭encouraged and continued in the future.‬
‭Moderate‬
‭Data Handling‬
‭Data validation and handling can be improved, although‬
‭this is a challenging task because the application ingests‬
‭a wide array of inputs. Issues we discovered related to‬
‭data handling include server-side request forgery (SSRF)‬
‭(‬‭TOB-RGM-8‬‭and‬‭TOB-RGM-12‬‭), Marshal deserialization‬
‭(‬‭TOB-RGM-3‬‭and‬‭TOB-RGM-9‬‭), JWT handling‬
‭(‬‭TOB-RGM-11‬‭,‬‭TOB-RGM-13‬‭, and‬‭TOB-RGM-14‬‭), and‬
‭cross-site scripting (XSS) (‬‭TOB-RGM-28‬‭). Consider‬
‭additional review and investments in this area.‬
‭Weak‬
‭Documentation‬
‭The system is well-documented and has good‬
‭documentation regarding public RubyGems functionality.‬
‭The repository also includes Markdown files that‬
‭document development workflows. We found a few‬
‭minor documentation discrepancies (‬‭TOB-RGM-7‬‭and‬
‭Code Quality #11‬‭). Consider reviewing public APIs‬‭for‬
‭appropriate documentation (e.g., web hook‬
‭functionality).‬
‭Strong‬
‭Maintenance‬
‭Overall, the system maintenance is good. The application‬
‭leverages Dependabot for dependency updates.‬
‭However, we found one low-severity issue regarding‬
‭patching (‬‭TOB-RGM-19‬‭) and a number of code quality‬
‭findings and findings due to the use of legacy‬
‭functionality (‬‭TOB-RGM-7‬‭and‬‭TOB-RGM-9‬‭). None of‬
‭Satisfactory‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭16‬

‭these findings imposes significant risk, but they do‬
‭represent opportunity for improvement.‬
‭Memory Safety‬
‭and Error‬
‭Handling‬
‭Due to the dynamic, garbage-collected nature of the‬
‭Ruby language, memory safety bugs were not a focus of‬
‭this audit. However, we did perform fuzz testing on a‬
‭Ruby C extension used by the application (‬‭appendix‬‭F.1‬‭).‬
‭Additional fuzz testing should be considered for any gem‬
‭dependencies that include a C extension component.‬
‭Error handling is generally well-implemented. We found a‬
‭few issues related to error handling (‬‭TOB-RGM-10‬‭,‬
‭TOB-RGM-15‬‭, and‬‭TOB-RGM-30‬‭), but all are‬
‭informational.‬
‭Strong‬
‭Testing and‬
‭Verification‬

‭Detailed Findings‬
‭1. Docker Compose ports exposed on all interfaces‬
‭Severity:‬‭Low‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Configuration‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-1‬
‭Target:‬‭rubygems.org/docker-compose.yml‬
‭Description‬
‭To specify Docker ports,‬‭docker-compose.yml‬‭configuration‬‭files use the‬‭ports‬
‭configuration option of, for example,‬‭5432:5432‬‭for‬‭the Postgres container (figure 1.1).‬
‭This means that these ports are accessible not just to other processes running on the same‬
‭computer, but also from other computers on the same network.‬
‭db‬‭:‬
‭image‬‭:‬‭postgres:13.14‬
‭ports‬‭:‬
‭-‬‭"5432:5432"‬
‭environment‬‭:‬
‭-‬‭POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust‬
‭Figure 1.1: Ports exposed on all interfaces (‬‭rubygems.org/docker-compose.yml:2–7‬‭)‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭A Ruby Central developer runs this‬‭docker-compose.yml‬‭file while on a public Wi-Fi‬
‭network. An attacker on the same network connects to the Postgres database running on‬
‭the developer’s computer; this database is available on port‬‭5432‬‭and uses the default‬
‭password‬‭postgres‬‭. The attacker can then read and‬‭modify any data in the developer’s‬
‭database.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, modify these configuration values, setting them to‬‭127.0.0.1:5432:5432‬
‭instead of‬‭5432:5432‬‭.‬
‭Long term, use the‬‭port-all-interfaces‬‭Semgrep static‬‭analysis rule to detect and flag‬
‭instances of this configuration pattern.‬

‭2. Rails cookies lack SameSite protections‬
‭Severity:‬‭Low‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Configuration‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-2‬
‭Target:‬‭rubygems.org/lib/github_oauthable.rb‬‭,‬
‭rubygems.org/config/initializers/session_store.rb‬
‭Description‬
‭As‬‭stated in MDN‬‭, the‬‭SameSite‬‭cookie attribute provides‬‭the following functionality:‬
‭Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-site requests, providing some‬
‭protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).‬
‭RubyGems disables strict‬‭SameSite‬‭protections in a‬‭number of locations by setting the‬
‭attributes value to‬‭Lax‬‭. For example, the following‬‭location sets this value explicitly:‬
‭def‬‭log_in_as‬‭(‬‭user‬‭:,‬‭expires‬‭:‬‭1‬‭.hour)‬
‭cookies.encrypted[admin_cookie_name]‬‭=‬‭{‬
‭value‬‭:‬‭user.id,‬
‭expires‬‭:‬‭expires,‬
‭same_site‬‭:‬‭:lax‬
‭}‬
‭end‬
‭Figure 2.1: Admin cookie setting‬‭SameSite=Lax‬
‭(‬‭rubygems.org/lib/github_oauthable.rb#72–78‬‭)‬
‭This value is also implicitly set on the Rails session cookie in the following location:‬
‭Rails‬‭.application.config.session_store‬‭:cookie_store‬‭,‬‭key‬‭:‬‭'_rubygems_session'‬
‭Figure 2.2: Session cookie implicitly setting‬‭SameSite‬‭=‬‭Lax‬
‭(‬‭rubygems.org/config/initializers/session_store.rb#8‬‭)‬
‭By default, when using‬‭cookie_store‬‭, the session cookie‬‭will set‬‭SameSite‬‭=‬‭Lax‬‭. This is‬
‭better than setting the value to‬‭None‬‭, but it still‬‭ultimately introduces the risk of CSRF‬
‭attacks. Because Rails provides built-in CSRF protections, this is a defense-in-depth‬
‭improvement; this finding’s severity is therefore low.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭An attacker discovers a GET-based CSRF vulnerability in the RubyGems application. They‬
‭then discover a bypass for built-in protections, or discover a controller that has set‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭22‬

‭skip_forgery_protection‬‭. They are then able to carry out the CSRF attack due to a lack‬
‭of‬‭SameSite‬‭protections on RubyGems cookies.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, configure‬‭SameSite‬‭=‬‭Strict‬‭on all application‬‭cookies.‬
‭Long term,‬‭incorporate the‬‭rails-cookie-attributes‬‭Semgrep rule from‬‭appendix E.2‬
‭into your CI systems.‬

‭3. Memcached cache store may allow Marshal deserialization‬
‭Severity:‬‭Informational‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Data Validation‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-3‬
‭Target:‬‭rubygems.org/config/environments/production.rb‬
‭Description‬
‭Deserialization of attacker-controlled‬‭Marshal‬‭data‬‭may result in remote code execution.‬
‭The RubyGems application uses Memcached as its cache store in the following location:‬
‭config.cache_store‬‭=‬‭:mem_cache_store‬‭,‬‭ENV‬‭[‬‭'MEMCACHED_ENDPOINT'‬‭]‬‭,‬‭{‬
‭failover‬‭:‬‭true‬‭,‬
‭socket_timeout‬‭:‬‭1‬‭.‬‭5‬‭,‬
‭socket_failure_delay‬‭:‬‭0‬‭.‬‭2‬‭,‬
‭compress‬‭:‬‭true‬‭,‬
‭compression_min_size‬‭:‬‭524_288‬‭,‬
‭value_max_bytes‬‭:‬‭2_097_152‬‭# 2MB‬
‭}‬
‭Figure 3.1: Rails Memcached cache store‬
‭(‬‭rubygems.org/config/environments/production.rb#116–123‬‭)‬
‭The‬‭:mem_cache_store‬‭symbol maps to the‬‭MemCacheStore‬‭,‬‭which subclasses‬
‭ActiveSupport::Cache::Store‬‭. This parent class allows‬‭a‬‭serializer‬‭to be‬
‭configured. The default serializer for Rails 7.1 is‬‭:marshal_7_1‬‭. The serializer can be‬
‭configured as‬‭:message_pack‬‭, which will‬‭default to‬‭a more secure serialization format;‬
‭however, it will‬‭fallback‬‭to the insecure Marshal‬‭format if it receives Marshal data. A custom‬
‭serializer is needed to completely mitigate this attack vector.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Memcached instance(s) used by the‬
‭RubyGems application. This could occur due a separate vulnerability such as server-side‬
‭request forgery (SSRF), or improper access controls configured on the Memcached‬
‭instance(s). The attacker could then add malicious, serialized Marshal objects to the‬
‭instance(s) that are later deserialized by the application, resulting in code execution.‬
‭At this time, we are unaware of any entrypoints to add malicious Marshal objects to‬
‭production Memcached instance(s), so we have marked this finding as informational.‬
‭However, similar attack chains have been observed. For example, GitHub Enterprise saw a‬
‭similar vulnerability chain presented in A New Era of SSRF, included in the References‬
‭section below.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭24‬

‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, create a custom JSON or‬‭MessagePack‬‭serializer‬‭that does not fallback on‬
‭deserializing Marshal data.‬‭ActiveSupport::Cache::Store‬‭supports specifying a‬
‭custom serializer module‬‭. Something similar to‬‭MessagePackWithFallback‬‭can be used,‬
‭except without the fallback.‬
‭Long term, incorporate the‬‭rails-cache-store-marshal‬‭Semgrep rule from‬‭appendix‬
‭E.2‬‭into your CI systems.‬

‭4. HSTS includeSubDomains disabled in production environment‬
‭Severity:‬‭Low‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Cryptography‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-4‬
‭Target:‬‭rubygems.org/config/environments/production.rb‬
‭Description‬
‭The HTTP‬‭Strict-Transport-Security‬‭(HSTS) response‬‭header ensures that‬
‭subsequent connections to a site are encrypted. Additionally, the‬‭includeSubDomains‬
‭directive applies the same configuration to all of a domain’s subdomains. The production‬
‭environment disables this functionality in the following location:‬
‭# Force all access to the app over SSL, use Strict-Transport-Security, and use‬
‭secure cookies.‬
‭config.force_ssl‬‭=‬‭true‬
‭config.ssl_options‬‭=‬‭{‬
‭hsts‬‭:‬‭{‬‭expires‬‭:‬‭365‬‭.days,‬‭subdomains‬‭:‬‭false‬‭},‬
‭redirect‬‭:‬‭{‬
‭exclude‬‭:‬‭->(request)‬‭{‬‭request.path.start_with?(‬‭'/internal'‬‭)‬‭}‬
‭}‬
‭}‬
‭Figure 4.1: HSTS‬‭includeSubDomains‬‭disabled‬
‭(‬‭rubygems.org/config/environments/production.rb#53–60‬‭)‬
‭Note that the staging environment repeats this configuration.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭An attacker can perform a downgrade attack against a target connecting to a subdomain of‬
‭RubyGems.org. They may also passively intercept subsequent HTTP connections after an‬
‭initial HTTPS connection to subdomains of RubyGems.org.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, enable the‬‭includeSubDomains‬‭directive‬‭for HSTS response headers.‬
‭Long term, incorporate the‬‭action-dispatch-insecure-ssl‬‭Semgrep rule from‬
‭appendix E.2‬‭into your CI systems.‬

‭5. SMTP mailer may fallback on unencrypted communication‬
‭Severity:‬‭High‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Cryptography‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-5‬
‭Target:‬‭rubygems.org/config/initializers/sendgrid.rb‬
‭Description‬
‭Rails uses‬‭ActionMailer‬‭to dynamically send emails.‬‭It uses the‬‭smtp_settings‬‭option‬
‭to configure its SMTP deliveries. The RubyGems application configures these settings in the‬
‭following location:‬
‭unless‬‭Rails‬‭.env.local?‬
‭ActionMailer‬‭::‬‭Base‬‭.smtp_settings‬‭=‬‭{‬
‭address‬‭:‬
‭'smtp.sendgrid.net'‬‭,‬
‭port‬‭:‬
‭587‬‭,‬
‭user_name‬‭:‬
‭ENV‬‭[‬‭'SENDGRID_USERNAME'‬‭],‬
‭password‬‭:‬
‭ENV‬‭[‬‭'SENDGRID_PASSWORD'‬‭],‬
‭domain‬‭:‬
‭'mailer.rubygems.org'‬‭,‬
‭authentication‬‭:‬
‭:plain‬‭,‬
‭enable_starttls_auto‬‭:‬‭true‬
‭}‬
‭ActionMailer‬‭::‬‭Base‬‭.delivery_method‬‭=‬‭:smtp‬
‭end‬
‭Figure 5.1: Rails SMTP configuration‬
‭(‬‭rubygems.org/config/initializers/sendgrid.rb#1–13‬‭)‬
‭The StartTLS protocol command is used to establish encrypted communication with the‬
‭SMTP server. The‬‭enable_starttls_auto‬‭setting attempts‬‭to establish an encrypted‬
‭channel, but falls back on unencrypted communication if it fails. However, the‬
‭enable_starttls‬‭setting requires a successful StartTLS‬‭and fails if it is unsupported.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭An attacker is in a privileged network position between the RubyGems application server‬
‭and the remote SMTP server. When the application server attempts to connect to the SMTP‬
‭server, the attacker removes StartTLS commands during the initial handshake. They then‬
‭return an unsupported error to the application server to downgrade the connection to an‬
‭unencrypted stream.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, change the‬‭enable_starttls_auto‬‭setting‬‭to‬‭enable_starttls‬‭.‬

‭6. Avo controller sets Content-Security-Policy unsafe_inline‬
‭Severity:‬‭Informational‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Configuration‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-6‬
‭Target:‬‭rubygems.org/config/initializers/avo.rb‬
‭Description‬
‭The‬‭Content-Security-Policy‬‭HTTP header allows web‬‭servers to specify content that‬
‭the web page will load. It is often used to protect against attacks like XSS and clickjacking.‬
‭The RubyGems application configures the Avo controller’s‬‭style-src‬‭to include‬
‭unsafe_inline‬‭:‬
‭Avo‬‭::‬‭ApplicationController‬‭.content_security_policy‬‭do‬‭|policy|‬
‭policy.style_src‬‭:self‬‭,‬‭"https://fonts.googleapis.com"‬‭,‬‭:unsafe_inline‬
‭end‬
‭Figure 6.1: Avo controller configures‬‭style-src‬‭with‬‭:unsafe_inline‬
‭(‬‭rubygems.org/config/initializers/avo.rb#141–143‬‭)‬
‭This allows including arbitrary inline‬‭style‬‭elements‬‭or attributes on elements (e.g., in‬
‭combination with HTML injection). We are unaware of any vulnerabilities that are‬
‭associated or could be chained with this functionality. However, privacy concerns or‬
‭unknown attack vectors may still exist, as‬‭style‬‭elements‬‭may import additional‬
‭stylesheets.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, remove the‬‭:unsafe_inline‬‭directive.‬
‭Long term, if the above recommendation is not feasible, consider using‬‭style-src‬‭nonces‬
‭(included in the References section below). These nonces allow a web page to verify the‬
‭integrity of the stylesheet data it is receiving.‬

‭Difficulty:‬‭Low‬
‭Type: Access Controls‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-7‬
‭Target:‬‭app/controllers/api/v1/web_hooks_controller.rb‬
‭Description‬
‭The RubyGems service offers web hook functionality for a user’s gems. The documentation‬
‭for this functionality is limited, and appears to be available only in the‬‭API documentation‬‭.‬
‭Web hooks have a “fire” API endpoint that allows a user to test their web hook:‬
‭def‬‭fire‬
‭webhook‬‭=‬‭@api_key‬‭.user.web_hooks.new(‬‭url‬‭:‬‭@url‬‭)‬
‭@rubygem‬‭||=‬‭Rubygem‬‭.find_by_name(‬‭"gemcutter"‬‭)‬

‭If the string “*” is provided as the gem name, then the application will fire a web hook for‬
‭the‬‭gemcutter‬‭gem. Any user can initiate this API‬‭call and send the result to a URL of their‬

‭Description‬
‭Web hook test “fire” functionality allows specifying sensitive hostnames like‬‭localhost‬
‭and IPs like‬‭10.0.0.1‬‭. This allows an attacker to‬‭perform SSRF attacks against internal‬
‭hosts. This functionality exists as an Active Job in the following locations:‬
‭def‬‭fire‬‭(protocol,‬‭host_with_port,‬‭version,‬‭delayed‬‭:‬‭true‬‭)‬

‭Tests to most internal URLs seemingly fail, which is not observable to the outside user.‬
‭However, firing a web hook to‬‭http://localhost:3000/api/v1/gems‬‭appears to‬
‭succeed, which indicates that SSRF attacks to internal hosts are possible.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭An attacker discovers an SSRF vulnerability in the web hook functionality. If they can‬
‭combine this with a‬‭CRLF injection‬‭in the underlying‬‭HTTP library, and a deserialization‬
‭vulnerability like‬‭TOB-RGM-3‬‭, then they may be able‬‭to inject arbitrary data into the cache‬
‭store and later achieve remote code execution. This attack chain is well-documented in A‬
‭New Era of SSRF, included in the References section below.‬
‭Similarly, an attacker may be able to make POST requests to arbitrary hosts on the internal‬
‭network. This is often not an exploit in and of itself, but SSRF vulnerabilities can commonly‬
‭be combined with other issues to achieve higher impact.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, proxy web hook HTTP requests through an application like‬‭Smokescreen‬‭. This‬
‭will prevent requests from reaching internal address space.‬
‭Long term, write automated tests to ensure that all web hook requests are proxied and‬
‭cannot reach internal address space.‬

‭9. Service stores spec Marshal data alongside gem file‬

‭rubygems.org/lib/tasks/helpers/gemcutter_tasks_helper.rb‬‭,‬
‭rubygems.org/lib/tasks/gemcutter.rake‬
‭Description‬
‭In Ruby, Marshal data presents a security risk because it can result in deserialization bugs,‬
‭which can lead to remote code execution. The Marshal module includes the‬‭following‬
‭warning‬‭:‬
‭By design, Marshal.load can deserialize almost any class loaded into the Ruby‬
‭process. In many cases‬‭this can lead to remote code‬‭execution if the Marshal data is‬
‭loaded from an untrusted source.‬
‭As a result, Marshal.load is not suitable as a general purpose serialization format‬
‭and‬‭you should never unmarshal user supplied input‬‭or other untrusted data.‬

‭The RubyGems application never uses this Marshaled spec data in an automated way.‬

‭The Marshaled spec data is also used in the‬‭rubygems‬‭repository (i.e., the‬‭gem‬‭and‬
‭bundler‬‭commands). Although this project is out of‬‭scope, and uses a‬‭SafeMarshal‬
‭implementation, it is still interesting to consider. The Marshaled spec data is used in the‬
‭Gem::Source‬‭and‬‭Bundler::Fetcher‬‭functionality. The‬‭former is commonly employed to‬
‭exploit Ruby Marshal deserialization bugs‬‭. If an attacker‬‭can find a bypass in the‬
‭SafeMarshal‬‭implementation, or otherwise convince‬‭a program to load that data, then‬
‭they could achieve code execution. Additionally, if a client that is not using the‬
‭SafeMarshal‬‭implementation—like the RubyGems Rake‬‭tasks—accesses that data, then it‬
‭is not protected.‬
‭While this Marshal functionality does not currently appear to be exploitable, removing it‬
‭and its associated functionality would reduce risk within the Ruby community as a whole;‬
‭this would remove both the ability to accidentally unmarshal potentially malicious data and‬
‭a common exploitation pattern for Ruby code.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭An attacker gains access to the S3 bucket storing Marshaled spec data. This could occur via‬
‭access control misconfiguration, SSRF, data validation issues during the gem upload‬
‭process, or some other attack vector. The attacker then uploads or modifies Marshaled‬
‭data such that when it is loaded, it exploits a deserialization bug.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, ensure that any clients accessing these Marshaled‬‭.rz‬‭files under the‬
‭rubygems‬‭GitHub organization are using the‬‭SafeMarshal‬‭implementation.‬
‭Long term, consider removing functionality associated with these‬‭.rz‬‭files, or moving to a‬
‭safer serialization format such as JSON. Alternatively, if the RubyGems service needs to‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭35‬

‭provide this information externally, then consider storing this metadata in the production‬
‭database instead of serialized data files in S3.‬

‭handler code is executed in the context of the deriving controller, which overrides the‬
‭render_bad_request‬‭function (figure 10.3). The overridden‬‭function has no arguments,‬

‭The system contains a few IAM resources that appear not to be used and should be‬

‭exploitable, these resources do not follow the principle of least privilege.‬
‭The below IAM users appear not to be used:‬
‭●‬ ‭chef‬‭: this account has some write privileges to EC2‬‭and Route53, does not have any‬
‭access credentials, has MFA disabled, and has never been used (according to Access‬
‭Advisor).‬
‭●‬ ‭nick‬‭: this account has administrative access, has‬‭only one inactive access key‬
‭configured, has MFA disabled, and has never been used (according to Access‬
‭Advisor).‬
‭The following IAM users were used long time ago and may be no longer needed:‬
‭●‬ ‭evan‬‭: this account has administrative access, does‬‭not have any access credentials,‬
‭MFA is disabled, was used 2 years ago last time‬
‭●‬ ‭dwradcliffe‬‭: this account has administrative access‬‭and was used 2 years ago last‬
‭time‬
‭●‬ ‭hsbt‬‭: this account has privileges for ECS and production‬‭S3 buckets, was used 1‬
‭year ago for S3 access and never used other privileges‬
‭●‬ ‭marty‬‭: this administrative account is actively used,‬‭but with an old and unused‬
‭access key.‬
‭●‬ ‭mux‬‭: this account with read-write S3 privileges, MFA‬‭is disabled‬
‭○‬ ‭The account has redundant‬‭S3:CreateJob‬‭permission‬‭for all resources‬
‭○‬ ‭Other write permissions are insecurely restricted to‬
‭arn:aws:s3:::*videos*‬‭resources: this gives access‬‭to, for example,‬
‭production gems with “videos” in their name‬
‭The following roles appear to have been created for‬‭OpsWorks service that reached end of‬
‭life‬‭:‬

‭●‬ ‭aws-opsworks-ec2-role‬
‭●‬ ‭aws-opsworks-service-role‬
‭Please note that the chef IAM user could be created for this service as well.‬
‭Multiple customer-managed policies do not have any entities attached:‬
‭●‬ ‭KarpenterController-2024021715281315410000000b‬
‭●‬ ‭es-staging-app‬
‭●‬ ‭rubyapi-secrets-manager-read-write‬
‭●‬ ‭RubyAPITerraformCloud‬‭(not used after fix for‬‭TOB-RGM-20‬‭)‬
‭●‬ ‭aws-load-balancer-controller‬‭(may be important for‬‭Helm configuration)‬
‭Additionally, we noted the following issues:‬
‭●‬ ‭The‬‭everything-backup‬‭policy (inlined in the‬‭dwradcliffe‬‭user) grants all‬
‭privileges on all resources, instead of read-only privileges.‬
‭●‬ ‭The‬‭Setup‬‭user group has no users assigned, so it‬‭can probably be removed.‬
‭●‬ ‭The‬‭shipit‬‭IAM user is included in the K8s‬‭system:masters‬‭group, but the IAM‬
‭user does not exist.‬
‭Exploit Scenario 1‬
‭The‬‭evan‬‭user reuses his AWS password for another‬‭popular service. The other service‬
‭suffers from data breach, and passwords are leaked. Mallory finds‬‭evan‬‭’s password in the‬
‭data dump; because MFA is disabled, Mallory successfully logs in as‬‭evan‬‭with only his‬
‭password. Mallory has admin access to all rubygems production resources and silently‬
‭installs backdoors in popular gems.‬
‭Exploit Scenario 2‬
‭The Mux user becomes malicious and backdoors all 23 gems with “videos” in their name.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, review the IAM resources pointed out in this finding, remove redundant‬
‭resources, and restrict privileges of other resources according to the principle of least‬
‭privilege. The precise actions required to do this depend on the business context that is‬
‭unknown to Trail of Bits; nevertheless, consider the following actions:‬
‭●‬ ‭For IAM users:‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove the‬‭check‬‭and‬‭nick‬‭IAM users.‬
‭●‬ ‭Enable MFA for the‬‭evan‬‭and Mux users.‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove‬‭dwradcliffe‬‭’s‬‭everything-backup‬‭policy.‬
‭●‬ ‭Limit‬‭hsbt‬‭’s privileges to S3 buckets.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬

‭●‬ ‭Remove the‬‭marty‬‭user’s access key.‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove Mux’s‬‭S3:CreateJob‬‭permission.‬
‭●‬ ‭Restrict Mux’s write permissions to specific S3 buckets and objects (instead of‬
‭the broad‬‭*videos*‬‭pattern).‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove OpsWorks-related roles. Remove unused policies. Remove the‬‭Setup‬‭user‬
‭group.‬
‭●‬ ‭Ensure that the root account has MFA enabled.‬
‭●‬ ‭Adjust EKS’‬‭kubernetes_config_map‬‭(in eks.tf file)‬‭and‬
‭kubernetes_role_binding‬‭resources (‬‭k8s-rbac.tf‬‭file)‬‭to match current IAM‬
‭resources. Add a step to the development and PR review processes that would‬
‭require review of K8s configurations whenever IAM resources are changed (and vice‬
‭versa).‬
‭●‬ ‭Long term, periodically review IAM resources and remove redundant ones.‬
‭●‬ ‭Move away from manual management of IAM resources. Migrate the management‬
‭to Terraform. Once the migration is complete, limit users and roles with write access‬
‭to production resources; ideally, only CI/CD pipeline and a break-glass user should‬
‭have access.‬
‭●‬ ‭When creating or updating IAM resources, ask for peer review of the new‬
‭configurations. This review should be made a required step in GitHub, and should‬
‭check if the new permissions are minimal.‬
‭●‬ ‭Whenever possible, migrate inlined and attached policies to groups and roles. This‬
‭will reduce the possibility of granting over-privileged accesses.‬
‭●‬ ‭Add AWS Config rules that would automate maintenance: remove inactive IAM‬
‭resources and disallow insecure configurations. Review‬‭asecurecloud’s conformance‬
‭packs‬‭for additional rules.‬

‭Description‬
‭The‬‭rubygems.org‬‭GitHub Action pipeline uses a third-party‬‭kubeconform‬‭action. This‬
‭action is part of the supply chain for CI/CD and can execute arbitrary code in the CI/CD‬

‭Moreover, no third-party actions in‬‭rubygems-terraform‬‭configuration are pinned by‬
‭hash, although all of these actions are trusted.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭An attacker uses social engineering to take over a private GitHub account with write‬
‭permissions for one of the untrusted GitHub actions. For example, a user uses an‬
‭already-leaked password and is convinced to send a 2FA code to the attacker. The attacker‬
‭updates the GitHub action to include code to exfiltrate all secrets in CI/CD pipelines that‬
‭use the action.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term,‬‭pin all external and third-party actions‬‭to a Git commit hash. Avoid pinning to a‬
‭Git tag, as these can be changed after creation. We also recommend using the‬
‭pin-github-action‬‭or‬‭frizbee‬‭tool to manage pinned‬‭actions.‬‭GitHub dependabot‬‭is‬
‭capable of updating GitHub Actions that use commit hashes.‬

‭52‬

‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Mallory creates a new account in HashiCorp. Due to the lack of sub claim validation, her‬
‭HashiCorp account is able to configure the OIDC to assume RubyGems’‬
‭RubyAPITerraformProvisioner‬‭role.‬
‭Mallory creates a new VPC configuration that later is incidentally attached to production‬
‭EC2 instances. The new VPC enables public access to private, internal services.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, remove the two insecure OIDC configurations.‬
‭Long term, migrate all configurations to Terraform and do not manually create or update‬
‭AWS resources. Doing so will enforce that all changes go through GitHub code-update‬
‭workflows like peer reviews and approvals.‬

‭Severity:‬‭Medium‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Access Controls‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-21‬
‭Target:‬‭AWS account‬
‭Description‬
‭AWS resources for the RubyGems project are managed with Terraform. Another project,‬
‭rubyapi‬‭, is not managed via Terraform (or its configurations‬‭are stored in a different‬
‭GitHub repository), but is deployed within the same AWS account as RubyGems. This‬
‭design does not follow the principle of least privilege and creates risks of lateral movement:‬
‭bugs in one project may be used to compromise the other one.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭A vulnerability in‬‭rubyapi‬‭’s AWS configuration enables‬‭attackers to modify all EC2‬
‭resources. The attacker exploits this bug to make malicious changes in RubyGems’ EC2‬
‭instances.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, implement one of the following recommendations:‬
‭1.‬ ‭Migrate all projects that use the single AWS account to Terraform.‬
‭2.‬ ‭Move‬‭rubyapi‬‭(and possibly other projects) to a separate‬‭AWS account.‬
‭The decision of which solution to choose depends mostly on business context like the‬
‭structure of the Ruby Central team. However, we recommend the second option, as it‬
‭provides stronger isolation and will help prevent not only attacks but also configuration‬
‭issues.‬
‭If the second option is chosen, then disable unused AWS Regions after projects are‬
‭separated. Unused but enabled regions may be used by attackers for stealth. Resources‬
‭assigned to regions can be found with, for example,‬‭AWS Tag Editor‬‭.‬
‭Long term, list and review all Ruby Central projects and AWS accounts in the organization,‬
‭and ensure that every project is either centrally managed or in a separate AWS account.‬
‭When creating new projects, move them to new AWS accounts from the beginning.‬

‭Please note that Fastly is permanently vulnerable to similar attacks, since this service does‬
‭not validate the account of an S3 owner before reading data or writing logs. That is, if a S3‬

‭Fastly.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭The Ruby Central team changes the bucket allowed to write to SQS but forgets to create the‬
‭new bucket. An attacker notices the issue and claims the bucket. The attacker can write‬
‭Fastly logs.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, add the‬‭aws:SourceAccount‬‭condition to‬‭the‬‭policy-allow-from-s3‬
‭policy. Change the‬‭Principal‬‭field of the policy to‬‭be equal to‬‭bucket_arn‬‭as a‬
‭defense-in-depth protection.‬
‭Long term, create a GitHub workflow that lists S3 buckets referenced in the Fastly‬
‭configuration, and check if the owner of all the buckets is the expected AWS account (see‬
‭also‬‭TOB-RGM-29‬‭). Alternatively, reference all S3‬‭buckets by variables and not with‬
‭hard-coded names in the Fastly configuration; this change should prevent usage of buckets‬

‭Description‬
‭GitHub Actions for‬‭rubygems-terraform‬‭repository (master‬‭branch) are granted all‬

‭Figure 23.1: Overly broad permissions for GitHub Actions‬
‭(‬‭rubygems-terraform/iam.tf#132–148‬‭)‬
‭To prevent‬‭GitHub Actions for‬‭rubygems-terraform‬‭repository‬‭from abusing IAM‬
‭permissions for privilege escalation, there are two possible solutions:‬
‭●‬ ‭Access policies boundaries‬‭: IAM resources created‬‭via Terraform would be restricted‬
‭with the same allowlist/denylist used to restrict the‬
‭github-actions-terraform-policy‬‭.‬
‭●‬ ‭Separate repository for IAM management: if changes to IAM are expected to be less‬
‭frequent and less urgent than changes to other services, then having a separate‬
‭code control repository with higher AWS privileges (to manage IAM resources), but‬
‭with stricter GitHub security configuration (like strict branch protection enabled),‬
‭would help to mitigate the privilege escalation attacks.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Mallory compromises the‬‭rubygems-terraform‬‭repository.‬‭She turns off monitoring and‬
‭alerting AWS services, and then installs backdoors in a few gems. Later, when the attack is‬
‭detected, she uses the repository to purge all AWS data, including all logs. It is much harder‬
‭to perform incident response and investigate the attack.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, limit permissions in the‬‭github-actions-terraform-policy‬‭policy:‬
‭●‬ ‭Only allow access to services that are actually managed via Terraform.‬
‭●‬ ‭Deny destructive access to logging, monitoring, alerting, and configuration services.‬
‭These services generally should be set up once and not disabled or modified‬
‭afterwards. For examples of access denylists, see the links in the Description section‬
‭above.‬
‭Additionally, restrict resources created/managed via Terraform with the same restrictions‬
‭as stated above. To do this, either use access policy boundaries or remove IAM permissions‬
‭from the policy and create a separate, more hardened GitHub Terraform repository and‬
‭role for only IAM management.‬
‭Long term, periodically review existing policies and roles and minimize privileges to the‬
‭necessary ones. Trim other full-access policies according to the recommendations above.‬

‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭A vulnerability in Kubernetes is exploited by a third party by directly accessing the EKS K8s‬

‭recommendations:‬
‭●‬ ‭Remove ingress port 22 from‬‭rubygems-common-all‬‭security‬‭group, or at least‬
‭restrict the CIDR block to a few IP addresses. Remove the‬‭rubygems-common-chef‬

‭install backdoors in Alice’s gem.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, remove the GitHub token from the “Set remote URL” step. If the token is‬
‭necessary for some further steps, then insert the credentials explicitly in those steps in a‬

‭buckets as data sources (origins). Using long-lived AWS credentials is non-avoidable.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, consider implementing authentication for Fastly logs using AWS roles. This‬
‭change should slightly improve security. However, this change requires creating both user‬
‭and roles for Fastly, which would increase overall complexity.‬

‭28. Stored XSS in gems.rubygemsusercontent.org‬
‭Severity:‬‭Low‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭Low‬
‭Type: Data Validation‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-28‬
‭Target:‬‭AWS S3 buckets and Fastly‬
‭Description‬
‭The‬‭gems.rubygemsusercontent.org‬‭domain serves user-controlled‬‭files with either‬
‭user-controlled or automatically deduced content types. This behavior enables users to‬
‭create persistent XSS exploits in the domain.‬
‭The domain is different from the more important RubyGems.org, so the severity of this‬
‭issue is very limited. However, users may trust the domain (as it belongs to Ruby Central),‬
‭and instances of XSS inside it may be unexpected. Moreover, there seems to be no‬
‭business value in serving user files with insecure content types.‬
‭The‬‭gems.rubygemsusercontent.org‬‭domain serves files‬‭from the‬
‭contents.oregon.production.s3.rubygems.org‬‭S3 bucket‬‭(figures 28.1–2). The‬
‭bucket holds objects created from gems source files (controlled by gems creators). The files‬
‭are served with the HTTP response‬‭Content-Type‬‭header‬‭taken from the object’s‬
‭metadata (figure 28.3).‬
‭contents‬‭=‬‭{‬
‭host‬
‭=‬‭"gems.rubygemsusercontent.org"‬
‭bucket_name‬‭=‬‭"contents.oregon.production.s3.rubygems.org"‬‭,‬

‭Figure 28.3: Example AWS metadata entries‬
‭The metadata is either controlled by gems owners or set automatically by AWS. In either‬
‭case, publishing a gem with an HTML file is sufficient to create an XSS payload.‬
‭As an example, the‬‭sogilis/csv_fast_importer‬‭repository‬‭stores a‬‭422.html‬‭file. The‬
‭file’s reference can be found with‬‭this link‬‭. Then,‬‭if opened with‬‭this URL‬‭, the HTML file is‬
‭served with the HTML content type.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Mallory publishes a gem with a malicious HTML file. The file contains JavaScript payload for‬
‭BeEF‬‭. Mallory easily phishes users to visit the website,‬‭as the users believe the domain to‬
‭be trusted.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, find how the‬‭Content-Type‬‭metadata is‬‭created when uploading objects to S3‬
‭buckets. If the metadata is user-provided, then create an allowlist of content types. If the‬
‭metadata is automatically deduced, then add an automatic request (sent after object‬
‭creation) that would update the‬‭Content-Type‬‭metadata‬‭to text/plain or octet/stream.‬
‭In either case, configure Fastly to overwrite content types of HTTP responses when serving‬
‭files from S3 buckets with text/plain and octet/stream.‬

‭29. OIDC S3 buckets are not claimed but are configured in Fastly‬
‭Severity:‬‭Medium‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Configuration‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-29‬
‭Target:‬‭rubygems-terraform/fastly/oidc-api-tokens.tf‬
‭Description‬
‭The Fastly configuration (figure 29.1) exposes a few subdomains of RubyGems.org with S3‬
‭buckets as data sources. The buckets are not claimed by anybody. An attacker can claim‬
‭them, effectively taking control over the subdomains.‬

‭Figure 29.1: Vulnerable S3 buckets and subdomains‬
‭(‬‭rubygems-terraform/fastly/oidc-api-tokens.tf#34–42‬‭)‬
‭The issue can be observed‬‭here‬‭.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Mallory finds out that the‬
‭compact-index.oregon.oidc-api-token.s3.rubygems.org‬‭S3 bucket is not‬
‭registered. She registers it and stores malicious JavaScript payloads there. Mallory can‬
‭conduct XSS-like attacks, try to circumvent CSRF protections, and exploit possible‬
‭misconfigurations of the RubyGems.org application.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, either claim the OIDC-related S3 buckets or remove relevant Fastly‬
‭configurations.‬
‭Long term, create a GitHub workflow that lists the S3 buckets referenced in the Fastly‬
‭configuration. Check if the buckets are registered and if the owner of all the buckets is the‬
‭expected AWS account.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭68‬

‭For the first task (list S3 buckets), the‬‭terraform‬‭command can be used (the command is‬
‭already used in the‬‭terraform.yml‬‭workflow). The second‬‭task requires AWS credentials;‬
‭however, the‬‭terraform.yml‬‭workflow already has the‬‭github-actions-terraform‬
‭AWS role, so it has necessary permissions for ownership checks.‬
‭Alternatively, manage all S3 buckets exclusively through Terraform. With this change, all‬
‭buckets will have to be referenced via variables (and not hard-coded ARN names), and if a‬
‭bucket is deleted, it would not be possible to reference it.‬

‭31. No dual approval requirement for production deployments‬
‭Severity:‬‭Medium‬
‭Difficulty:‬‭High‬
‭Type: Access Controls‬
‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-31‬
‭Target: AWS IAM, Fastly‬
‭Description‬
‭The RubyGems system is deployed in AWS based on Terraform files stored in the‬
‭rubygems-terraform‬‭GitHub repository. Changes to the‬‭repository do not require dual‬
‭approval (confirmation of changes by at least two people).‬
‭Moreover, as the‬‭Wiki/Deploys page informs‬‭, application‬‭deployments to the EKS via the‬
‭Shipit application also do not require dual approval.‬
‭Exploit Scenario 1‬
‭A GitHub user with access to the‬‭rubygems-terraform‬‭repository is compromised. The‬
‭attacker makes changes to the Terraform files and pushes them to master. The GitHub‬
‭Actions run the workflow that automatically updates AWS production resources. The attack‬
‭goes unnoticed for a few days.‬
‭Exploit Scenario 2‬
‭An honest user with access to the Shipit application makes a mistake and chooses a wrong‬
‭commit for production deployment. A broken application is deployed. The RubyGems‬
‭application is down for a few hours.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, ensure that all users with access to the‬‭rubygems-terraform‬‭repository and‬
‭Shipit application have 2FA enabled and follow‬‭GitHub’s‬‭other security recommendations‬‭.‬
‭Ideally, developers should use only security keys/WebAuthn 2FA (instead of TOTP), and‬
‭should manage their SSH keys with hardware security keys.‬
‭Implement‬‭branch protection rules‬‭for‬‭rubygems-terraform‬‭.‬‭At a minimum, require pull‬
‭requests and an approval before merging, e.g.:‬
‭●‬ ‭Require a pull request before merging‬
‭●‬ ‭At least one approval‬
‭●‬ ‭Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭71‬

‭●‬ ‭Require approval of the most recent reviewable push‬
‭●‬ ‭Block force pushes‬
‭Because of the small size of the Ruby Central team, the above recommendation may not be‬
‭viable: emergency changes would be paused until other team members—likely living in‬
‭different time zones—would come online. On the other hand, emergency events should be‬
‭rare.‬
‭For a more balanced solution, we recommend configuring the protections above and‬
‭enabling “break-glass” access. The break-glass would allow bypassing branch protections,‬
‭but in a noisy way: alerts to out-of-band services (like Slack or emails) would be sent, and‬
‭other team members would be asked to review the PRs merged without approval when‬
‭they come online. These notifications should be more visible than normal events (like‬
‭regular PR merging).‬
‭This recommendation would not prevent attacks in case of GitHub account compromise,‬
‭but would help the team to detect and respond to such incidents.‬
‭A possible drawback is a user fatigue problem: if noisy alerts are sent too often, developers‬
‭will start ignoring them. Therefore, this recommendation is only useful if the emergency‬
‭PRs would be rare. If that is not currently the case, these recommendations should be‬
‭reviewed again once the development process becomes more stable.‬
‭As for possible implementation, the‬‭emergency-pull-request-probot-app‬‭application‬
‭could be used. Its security posture is undetermined, but since it is GitHub’s application, it‬
‭should be fine to use.‬
‭Finally, there is the problem of a compromised GitHub account changing branch protection‬
‭rules. If all developers are given full administrative rights to the repository, then all‬
‭recommendations given above are effectively not useful: an attacker can first disable the‬
‭protections, then introduce malicious changes, and then re-enable protections. We were‬
‭unaware of the specific structure of the Ruby Central team during the audit, more‬
‭consideration is required to determine the viability of the above recommendations. If the‬
‭rubygems-terraform‬‭repository has too few maintainers,‬‭it is possible that‬
‭organization-level rulesets‬‭can be used to protect‬‭the repository while making the‬
‭“break-glass” solution useful.‬
‭If possible, configure dual approval requirements in the Shipit application, possibly with a‬
‭similar “break-glass” mechanism.‬

‭32. The app-production user’s API key has not been rotated for a long time‬
‭Severity:‬‭Medium‬

‭Finding ID: TOB-RGM-32‬
‭Target: AWS IAM‬
‭Description‬
‭The AWS access keys for the‬‭app-production‬‭and‬‭app-staging‬‭users were created‬
‭about six years ago. These keys give write access to production/staging S3 buckets. Keys‬
‭are mounted in K8s pods. The keys should be rotated as soon as possible. Moreover, the‬
‭key should be rotated regularly at least once every two years.‬
‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭The‬‭app-production‬‭user’s API key was compromised‬‭a few years ago via undisclosed‬
‭vulnerabilities in old versions of the RubyGems Rails application. An attacker kept the key‬
‭unused until now. The attacker backdoors a few popular gems by manipulating S3 buckets’‬
‭content.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, manually rotate the API keys as soon as possible. Create a process for rotating‬
‭the keys regularly, at least once every two years. Ideally, key rotation should be automated‬
‭and done during every new deployment. Such automation will mitigate the risk of not‬
‭rotating the key after a vulnerability fix.‬

‭Target: AWS EKS,‬‭shipit‬
‭Description‬
‭The Shipit deployment application uses the‬‭shipit‬‭ServiceAccount‬‭to manage K8s‬
‭deployments. The account is in the‬‭cluster-admin‬‭groups‬‭of both staging and production‬
‭namespaces‬‭. The‬‭staging‬‭GitHub branch‬‭is automatically‬‭deployed‬‭to the K8s staging‬
‭environment. If a buggy configuration is pushed to the branch, it may impact production‬
‭K8s resources.‬
‭Exploit Scenario 1‬
‭A buggy K8s configuration is pushed to the‬‭staging‬‭branch. Shipit automatically deploys‬
‭the changes. Production resources are accidentally impacted, and rubygems is down for a‬
‭few hours.‬
‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, create separate K8s accounts for staging and production environments. Make‬
‭the staging deployments use the lower-privileged account. Details of the implementation‬
‭depend on the Shipit features and the available configuration options.‬

‭C. Code Quality Findings‬
‭This appendix contains findings that do not have immediate or obvious security‬
‭implications or that were discovered but not fully investigated due to time constraints or‬
‭scope limitations.‬
‭1.‬ ‭The‬‭ingress‬‭and‬‭egress‬‭arguments‬‭are not recommended‬‭in Terraform files.‬
‭The‬‭aws_vpc_security_group_{ingress,egress}_rule‬‭resources‬‭should be‬
‭used instead.‬
‭2.‬ ‭Terraform files should consistently use the‬‭recommended‬‭jsonencode‬
‭function‬‭for inline policies.‬‭A “hand-written” JSON‬‭policy, as in figure C.2.1, is not‬
‭recommended.‬

‭}‬
‭POLICY‬
‭Figure C.2.1: Example policy written in the not recommended style‬
‭(‬‭rubygems-terraform/eks.tf#99–112‬‭)‬
‭3.‬ ‭The‬‭/app/tmp/local_secret.txt‬‭file is not removed‬‭from Docker images‬
‭published in the RubyGems’ ECR.‬‭The images are stored‬‭in a private ECR registry,‬
‭but with read permissions for all AWS users; they should therefore be treated as‬
‭publicly available. Since secret is used only in Rails testing builds, leaking it does not‬
‭have serious security consequences; nevertheless, the exposure is unnecessary, and‬
‭we recommend updating the Docker build script so that the file is removed.‬
‭4.‬ ‭The‬‭is_s3_request‬‭condition in Fastly configuration‬‭should use only the‬
‭request's path and not the whole URL (with query parameters).‬‭For example,‬
‭the following URL would result in a match:‬
‭/gems/example-1.0.0?some-param&.gem‬‭. This issue may‬‭result in exposure of‬
‭unintended files from the S3 bucket.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭79‬

‭5.‬ ‭The‬‭request_conditions‬‭in the Fastly configuration should be mutually‬
‭exclusive.‬‭For example, the‬‭is_s3_request‬‭and‬‭is_contents_s3_request‬
‭conditions may both be true for a single request, making it possible to download‬
‭gems from both gems.rubygemsusercontent.org and RubyGems.org.‬
‭6.‬ ‭Infinite client-side redirect loop.‬‭Fastly and/or‬‭nginx are misconfigured, resulting‬
‭in an infinite redirect loop for some requests. An example command to observe the‬
‭issue is given in figure C.6.1.‬
‭curl -L -k -v‬
‭'https://754b69fa-rubygemsproductio-4184-1999396523.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/‬
‭Figure C.6.1: Example command to trigger infinite redirects loop‬
‭7.‬ ‭Not all RubyGems AWS resources are managed by Terraform.‬‭For example, the‬
‭rubygems-eks-role‬‭is created manually, but is referenced‬‭in the‬‭eks.tf‬‭file.‬
‭8.‬ ‭“Your account has been deleted from %{host}” email title.‬‭After an account is‬
‭removed from the RubyGems.org website, an email with a title containing a‬
‭placeholder is sent. Review the configuration of email templates and update them‬
‭to correctly replace the host placeholder.‬
‭9.‬ ‭The‬‭config/initializers/cookie_rotator.rb‬‭initializer‬‭may no longer be‬
‭needed.‬‭When‬‭upgrading to Rails 7.0‬‭, a cookie rotator‬‭initializer may be necessary.‬
‭This file was added in February 2023 to the RubyGems codebase. If the Rails session‬
‭cookie time to live (TTL) is less than that, then this file is no longer necessary.‬
‭10.‬‭The‬‭xml-simple‬‭dependency appears unused.‬‭Searching‬‭the codebase for‬
‭XmlSimple‬‭yields no results, so we assume it is unused.‬‭The only evidence of its use‬
‭we could find was‬‭#73‬‭. Further, many models implement‬‭a‬‭to_xml‬‭method, but it‬
‭appears that this functionality is also unused. If both this dependency and‬
‭functionality are indeed unused, consider removing them to reduce the attack‬
‭surface and maintenance burden.‬
‭11.‬‭The‬‭dependencies‬‭API is‬‭still documented‬‭, but it appears‬‭that it is no longer‬
‭available (figure C.11.1). Consider removing the documentation of this functionality.‬
‭$‬‭curl‬‭https://rubygems.org/api/v1/‬‭dependencies‬‭?gems=rails‬

‭12.‬‭The‬‭/api/v1/versions/[GEM NAME]/latest.json‬‭API endpoint‬‭will serve‬

‭signature could be then‬‭verified by AWS EKS‬‭. This‬‭feature would prevent the EKS‬
‭from loading malicious images. Interoperability of these signing and verification‬
‭features was not determined during the audit.‬

‭not determine the usefulness of the password during the audit. If the credentials‬
‭are used in production, then rotate them, move to secure storage, and perform‬
‭actions according to the relevant incident response plan.‬

‭Recommendations‬
‭Based on the results of the competitive analysis, we recommend taking the following‬
‭actions to increase RubyGems’ security. We have divided the recommendations into two‬
‭sections: ones that are more important and should be focused on in the near future, and‬
‭ones that are less urgent and can be planned in the long term.‬
‭High priority‬
‭●‬ ‭Continue to increase adoption of MFA among gem owners:‬
‭●‬ ‭Continuously expand the MFA requirement to less popular gems.‬
‭●‬ ‭Broaden the MFA requirement to not only popular gems, but also the‬
‭runtime dependencies of those gems. At a minimum, the dependencies of‬
‭gems’ most recent versions should be covered. The requirement is not‬
‭necessary for dependencies locked to specific versions (as the published‬
‭versions are immutable), but recommended anyway.‬
‭●‬ ‭Ideally, the MFA requirement should cover all gem owners.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭85‬

‭●‬ ‭Start enforcing phishing-resistant MFA requirements for maintainers of the most‬
‭popular packages. That would mean an enforcement of security devices instead of‬
‭OTP tokens. When this requirement is implemented, the maintainers should be‬
‭strongly advised to register at least two security devices (one for a backup).‬
‭●‬ ‭Add support for provenances. This recommendation has two sub-tasks: support for‬
‭attestations in RubyGems API, and automatic verification by the registry (on import‬
‭to repo) and by CLI tools (on install). This recommendation would enable‬
‭deprecation of the‬‭gem signing feature‬‭. An example‬‭of in-progress implementation‬
‭is‬‭PEP 740‬‭.‬
‭●‬ ‭Add support for more vendors to the Trusted Publishing feature. Selection of‬
‭specific vendors should be consulted with the community.‬
‭●‬ ‭Add documentation in the RubyGems.org website for reporting malware and‬
‭suspicious gems. Currently, only documentation for reporting vulnerabilities in gems‬
‭and RubyGems.org exists. If the malware reports should be sent as GitHub issues,‬
‭then create a dedicated template for that. Otherwise, create a dedicated web page‬
‭on the website (with HTML form) or point to the email address and instruct users‬
‭what the email message with the report should contain. Create a “report as‬
‭malware” button in the UI. In the future, consider implementing the future in CLI‬
‭and API. For an example implementation, see‬‭PyPI’s‬‭security page‬‭and its “report as‬
‭malware” button and‬‭NPM documentation‬‭; for ideas,‬‭see the announcement of‬‭PyPI‬
‭Malware Reporting and Response project‬‭.‬
‭●‬ ‭Improve UX around API key expiration times.‬
‭●‬ ‭When generating the keys in UI, the expiration time should be set to some‬
‭default value like 30 days.‬
‭●‬ ‭When automatically generating API keys in CLI for sign in, the keys should be‬
‭set with some default expiration time.‬
‭●‬ ‭Users could be presented with some common expiration options in the UI‬
‭(like 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, infinite), in addition to the calendar.‬
‭●‬ ‭Review the security of the CLI against common filesystem-related attacks. At least‬
‭the‬‭gem install‬‭command should not follow symlinks‬‭when extracting‬
‭repositories, and should respect the local umask settings.‬
‭Low–medium priority‬
‭●‬ ‭Add documentation for password recovery. This recovery process is usually‬
‭straightforward, consisting of an email with a password change link. However, the‬
‭doc may cover more complex cases:‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭86‬

‭●‬ ‭What is needed for password recovery when MFA is enabled?‬
‭●‬ ‭What should a user do if they lose access to their email?‬
‭●‬ ‭What should the user do if their email inbox is compromised?‬
‭●‬ ‭Can the Ruby team help in these cases and if so how to contact it?‬
‭●‬ ‭Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) for maintainer accounts. This could‬
‭consist of two roles: owners (allowed to manage other accounts/roles and gems)‬
‭and maintainers (allowed to manage gems). Alternatively, roles could correspond to‬
‭granular privileges of API keys (owners with all privileges who can give a subset of‬
‭privileges to other owners).‬
‭●‬ ‭Integrate with GitLab’s Secret Detection to automatically revoke leaked API tokens.‬
‭●‬ ‭Add warnings in the UI for dependencies with known vulnerabilities. At a minimum,‬
‭owners of a gem should be shown a warning, but ideally that information should be‬
‭visible to all visitors. See‬‭crates.io issue #6397‬‭for ideas.‬
‭●‬ ‭Publish an event transparency log (like‬‭replicate.npmjs.com‬‭,‬‭which is an‬
‭instance of CouchDB). The log will help users to find and investigate security issues‬
‭at scale.‬
‭●‬ ‭Make the‬‭gem install‬‭command (and other relevant commands)‬‭warn users‬
‭about known vulnerabilities.‬
‭●‬ ‭Improve the gems CLI to reach level 3 of the Principles for Package Repository‬
‭Security:‬
‭●‬ ‭Add an SBOM generation command (like the‬‭npm-sbom‬‭).‬
‭●‬ ‭Add a feature to‬‭gem‬‭or‬‭bundler‬‭for automatic updates‬‭of vulnerable‬
‭dependencies.‬
‭●‬ ‭Reduce the false positives rate in‬‭bundler-audit‬‭by‬‭leveraging static‬
‭analysis (like‬‭govulncheck‬‭).‬
‭●‬ ‭Improve the gems CLI with additional security features:‬
‭●‬ ‭Add a command for checking security audits done for dependencies, similar‬
‭to‬‭cargo-vet‬‭and‬‭cargo-crev‬‭.‬
‭●‬ ‭Add a command for listing all implicit trust relationships in dependencies,‬
‭similar to‬‭cargo-supply-chain‬‭.‬
‭Trail of Bits‬
‭87‬

‭●‬ ‭Add a command for checking if a package is unmaintained, similar to‬
‭cargo-audit‬‭and‬‭cargo-unmaintained‬‭. This feature may‬‭require creating‬
‭new types of entries in‬‭ruby-advisory-db‬‭.‬
‭●‬ ‭Add a new restriction to API keys: allowlisted source IP addresses. Users should be‬
‭able to set the allowed IP address range when generating tokens in the UI/CLI/API.‬
‭Consider automatically setting the IP allowlist when the gems CLI generates new‬
‭tokens for user authentication (‬‭gem signin‬‭command);‬‭note that this would‬
‭require the CLI to detect the user’s public IP.‬
‭●‬ ‭Consider storing API keys generated by the CLI in a secure location instead of a file.‬
‭That location could be a‬‭keychain‬‭,‬‭keyring‬‭, keystore,‬‭or‬‭credential manager‬‭. This‬
‭would prevent API key leaks in case of a stolen device (with full-disk encryption not‬
‭enabled) and mitigate attacks by malware.‬

‭E. Automated Static Analysis‬
‭This appendix describes the setup of the automated analysis tools used during this audit.‬
‭Though static analysis tools frequently report false positives, they detect certain categories‬
‭of issues, such as memory leaks, misspecified format strings, and the use of unsafe APIs,‬
‭with essentially perfect precision. We recommend periodically running these static analysis‬
‭tools and reviewing their findings. For more information, see the Trail of Bits Testing‬
‭Handbook section on‬‭static analysis‬‭.‬
‭For any of the tools below that support it, we used‬‭SARIF Explorer‬‭—a VSCode extension‬
‭that enhances the triaging process—to review the results.‬
‭E.1 Semgrep‬
‭We installed Semgrep by following‬‭Semgrep’s installation‬‭guide‬‭. Then, we installed the‬
‭Semgrep Pro Engine‬‭, which includes cross-file (interfile)‬‭and cross-function‬
‭(interprocedural) analysis. To run Semgrep with the Pro Engine, we used the following‬
‭commands:‬
‭semgrep‬‭login‬
‭semgrep‬‭install-semgrep-pro‬
‭To run Semgrep on the codebase, we ran the following command in the root directory of all‬
‭provided source code directories:‬
‭semgrep‬‭--pro‬‭--config=auto‬‭--sarif‬‭>‬‭semgrep.sarif‬
‭To run Semgrep to identify potential secrets in the codebase, we used the following‬
‭command:‬
‭semgrep‬‭-c‬‭p/secrets‬
‭To run Semgrep with every rule—leading to more findings, many of which are false‬
‭positives—the following command can be used:‬
‭semgrep‬‭--pro‬‭--config=r/all‬‭--sarif‬‭>‬‭semgrep.sarif‬
‭The following public Semgrep rulesets were used during this audit:‬
‭●‬ ‭/p/ruby‬
‭●‬ ‭/p/secrets‬
‭●‬ ‭/p/dockerfile‬

‭F. Fuzz Testing‬
‭This appendix describes the setup of the fuzz testing tools used during this audit.‬
‭We recommend fuzz testing code that handles untrusted input, such as code that performs‬
‭parsing, decoding, deserializing, or other types of heavy processing of input. Fuzzing often‬
‭finds memory corruption bugs or other unintended crashes. For more information, see the‬
‭Trail of Bits Testing Handbook section on‬‭fuzzing‬‭.‬
‭F.1 Ruzzy‬
‭We installed Ruzzy by following‬‭Ruzzy’s installation‬‭guide‬‭. We identified the Ruby‬‭cbor‬
‭library as a good candidate for fuzzing due to its deserialization of binary data and its C‬
‭extension component. The‬‭cbor‬‭library is used by the‬‭WebAuthn‬‭functionality within‬
‭RubyGems. We used the following fuzzing harness to fuzz‬‭cbor‬‭:‬
‭# frozen_string_literal: true‬
‭require‬‭'cbor'‬
‭require‬‭'ruzzy'‬
‭test_one_input‬‭=‬‭lambda‬‭do‬‭|data|‬
‭begin‬
‭CBOR‬‭.decode(data)‬
‭rescue‬‭Exception‬
‭# We're looking for memory corruption, not Ruby‬‭exceptions‬
‭end‬
‭return‬‭0‬
‭end‬
‭Ruzzy‬‭.fuzz(test_one_input)‬
‭Figure F.1: The‬‭cbor‬‭fuzzing harness‬
‭We used this harness and Ruzzy’s standard procedure for‬‭fuzzing Ruby C extensions‬‭. We‬
‭fuzzed the target for several hours, which yielded no findings. Consider applying this‬
‭process to additional input processing targets used by the application.‬

‭G. Dynamic Analysis Using Burp Suite Professional‬
‭This appendix describes the setup of Burp Suite Professional, the dynamic analysis tool‬
‭used during this audit.‬
‭We dynamically scanned the RubyGems web interface with Burp Suite Professional, which‬
‭allowed us to identify several issues.‬
‭Strategy‬
‭●‬ ‭Scanning using a live task:‬‭We interacted with the‬‭web interface in RubyGems and‬
‭had underlying requests processed by a live task and sent to the active scanner with‬
‭the‬‭maximum coverage‬‭set and extensions enabled.‬
‭●‬ ‭Active Burp scanner:‬‭When interacting with the RubyGems‬‭web interface through‬
‭Burp Repeater, we sent underlying requests to the active scanner with the‬
‭maximum coverage setting.‬
‭●‬ ‭Manual interaction in Burp Repeater:‬‭Analyzing the‬‭particular functionality of the‬
‭targeted application, we sent a given request to Burp Repeater, changed the‬
‭request, and observed the potentially malicious output.‬
‭Extensions‬
‭During the assessment, we also used the following Burp Suite Professional extensions to‬
‭enhance the functionality of our auditing process:‬
‭●‬ ‭Turbo Intruder‬‭allows users to send large numbers‬‭of customized HTTP requests. It‬
‭is intended to supplement Burp Intruder by handling attacks that require extreme‬
‭speed or complexity. We used this extension to check whether the API is vulnerable‬
‭to‬‭race conditions‬‭.‬
‭●‬ ‭Active Scan++‬‭enhances the default active and passive‬‭scanning capabilities of Burp‬
‭Suite Professional. It adds checks for vulnerabilities that the default scanner might‬
‭miss (e.g., blind code injection via Ruby’s‬‭open‬‭function‬‭and suspicious‬
‭transformations, such as‬‭7*7‬‭=>‬‭‘49’‬‭).‬
‭●‬ ‭Backslash Powered Scanner‬‭extends the active scanner‬‭capabilities by trying to‬
‭identify known and unknown classes of server-side injection vulnerabilities.‬
